<p>The southeasternmost region of Finland is called <b>Kymenlaakso</b>, which means Kymi Valley
in Finnish.  It is not the largest region of Finland, nor the most important one; and it does not
correspond to any historical province, as its territory used to be split between Uusimaa, Karelia,
and Tavastia.  Its population is 180,000 which, honestly, isn't that much.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, Kymenlaakso in my opinion has a distinct and charming personality.  Over the
    last year I've seen a fair bit of Finland; so far I haven't really seen any towns or places
    I really disliked, but I must admit some places do really seem a bit bland (Mikkeli
    and Joensuu come to mind, for example).  Kymenlaakso, on the other hand, is really
    a place you just want to come back to again and again.  And best of all, it is very close
    to the Russian border, so you can come and visit and see quite a bit over just a weekend.</p>

<p>Kymenlaakso consists of three cities (Kotka, Hamina, and Kouvola), and several rural
    municipalities.  Its geography is typical of Southern Finland: jagged rocky coast with 
    numerous skerry guards, and bright pine forests inland.  Kymenlaakso lies just outside
    the great Finnish lakeland, and it has no major lakes and just one major river, but it's
    a pretty big one, named Kymi (Kymijoki).  Kymi is one of the few rivers penetrating
    the Salpausselkä Ridge <i>(Finn. Padlock Ridge)</i>, a low but solid ridge marking
    the southernmost border of the Ice Age
    glacier (in other words, a terminal morraine).  Päijänne Lake, the second largest lake
    system of Finland, drains through Kymi into the Gulf of Finland; however Päijänne itself
    does not belong to Kymenlaakso.</p>
     
<p>Kymenlaakso naturally splits into two subregions: Kotka-Hamina is the part
    of Kymenlaakso along the coast of the Gulf of Finland, and Kouvola is the more inland part.  
    Kotka-Hamina subregion, in particular, promotes itself as "The Coast of Good Winds",
    under "Southwest 135&deg;" brand; see
    their <a target="_blank" href="http://www.southeast135.fi/">tourist website</a>.
    And while "The Coast of Good Winds" might not be an especially imaginative slogan,
    it really suits this place, as I learned in my solo weekend road trip in September
    2015, which I'm about to tell you about.</p>
    
<p>I visited the Salpa Line Museum and the city of Hamina in the first day, then
    slept in a cabin in Pitkäthiekat Camping near Hamina, and then saw Kotka 
    and its Vellamo Marine Museum in the second day.  Still, this series of posts will be
    a little out of the chronological order; first I intend to tell of the bits which
    do not belong elsewhere.</p>
    

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5821/21274492890_7e236dce7a_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5821/21274492890_267f0209d0_c.jpg 1x, https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5821/21274492890_4620c87744_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="532" alt="1" title="Map of Virolahti" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>1. If you pay attention when you enter Finland from Russia through the main border crossing
    point, Torfyanovka-Vaalimaa (on the E18 European Route, St. Petersburg&nbsp;&mdash;
    Helsinki[&nbsp;&mdash; Turku&nbsp&mdash; Stockholm&nbsp;&mdash; Oslo]),
    you may notice two signs, saying <i>Kymenlaakso</i> and <i>Virolahti</i>.  And Virolahti
    Municipality is indeed the very first municipality of Finland you'll see on your way towards
    Helsinki, if only briefly.   
</p>

<p>Virolahti is a rural municipality, with population of about 3,500.  Its name
    means "Estonian Bay"; <i>Viro</i> means "Estonia" in Finnish.  Virolahti villages
    sprung up here, along the King's Road, back in the middle ages, and apart from
    fishing and farming, the major occupation of the locals was trade with Estonia
    across the Gulf of Finland.  There is a word in Swedish without a precisde
    translation, <i>bondeseglationen</i>; it more or less means sea trade carried on
    by local peasants, as opposed to merchants; and <i>bondeseglationen</i> was
    very popular with Virolahti locals.
    
      The Gulf of Finland itself is 120 km wide here (it's pretty much
    its widest part); Estonian cities of Narva and Sillamäe lie across it.  
    Virolahti Bay itself, about 10x3 km in size, is clearly visible in the east of
    the map on the picture.  The eastern coast of this bay is Russian territory
    already.</p>

<p>Municipalities in Finland can be divided into cities <i>(kaupunki)</i> and
rural municipalities <i>(kunta)</i>.  Rural municipalities typically have the
central village <i>(keskustaajama)</i> and the church village <i>(kirkonkylä)</i>,
which in practice are often the same village.  Church villages were historically more important,
being the parish centers.  In case of Virolahti these are different;
the central village is Virojoki, and the church village is literally named Virolahden
Kirkonkylä.</p>

<p>Virojoki village can be briefly seen while driving on the main National Road 7
    from the Russian border to Helsinki, although this will change in a few years;
    the last motorway section of Road 7, from Hamina to Russian border (32 km),
    is due to be finished by 2018.  I didn't stop in Virojoki itself and drove
    straight to Virolahden Kirkonkylä, a few kilometers to the south.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5655/21274496710_a3acbeacc1_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5655/21274496710_fc549dca38_c.jpg 1x, https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5655/21274496710_e66fbcbef3_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="532" alt="2" title="Virolahti Church" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>2. So here is the church at Virolahden Kirkonkylä.  It is a wooden church
    with a large wooden belltower, built in 1768.  Some service has just ended
    as I drove near; probably a funeral service, as most people leaving wore black.
    I didn't enter the church itself, and I didn't explore the village as well,
    which is a pity.  The oldest building of Virolahti is located just beyond
    this church; it's a small stone sacristy, built in the 16th century.
</p>

<p>To the southeast of Virolahden Kirkonkylä there is a village named Hurppu,
    which is notable as the place of summer residence of Russian Emperor Nicholas II.
    Russian emperors valued Finland for its calmness (which remains a distinctive trait
    of Finland to this day).  Alexander III in particular loved fishing in Kotka,
    also in Kymenlaakso, and his fishing lodge remains a significant modern attraction.
    And his son, Nicholas II, preferred Virolahti, but he used to spend most of his time here aboard his 
    steam yacht named <i>Standart</i>, and virtually no traces of the last Russian tsar 
    remain on Virolahti coast itself.  Perhaps the memory of Nicholas II is the 
    reason behind <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hurppu.fi/">this</a> project 
    of building an extremely luxurious hotel in Hurppu that I found.  Its investor
    is Russian, it seems.</p>
    
<p>Another place connecting Virolahti to Russian history is its granite quarries
    in Pyterlahti village, between Virojoki and Virolahden Kirkonkylä.  These quarries
    are where the granite for the columns of the magnificent St. Isaac's Cathedral,
    Troitsky Bridge <i>(Russ. Trinity Bridge)</i>, Alexander I Column, and various other
    landmarks and buildings of St. Petersburg was mined.  This distinctive grainy variety of granite is 
    also known as <i>rapakivi</i> <i>(Finn. crumbly rock)</i>.  The old quarries
    can still be seen near Pyterlahti, and mining operations continue in the newer
    quarries to this day.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5752/20841453683_8d5093e6b5_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5752/20841453683_7b5be345bd_c.jpg 1x, https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5752/20841453683_ef1762c7ba_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="532" alt="3" title="King's Road" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>3. Modern National Road 7 connects Virolahti and Hamina.  The road bypasses most
    local villages (apart from Virojoki), and despite being an ordinary two-lane
    road for now, it is straight enough that overtaking etc. is simple enough.  This road
    however was constructed only in the 1960s, and before that the only east-west
    route in this part was the ancient King's Road.
</p>

<p>The King's Road, or <i>Kuninkaantie</i> in Finnish, is one of the old roads of Finland,
    known since the Middle Ages.  It originally connected Turky (Åbo) with Vyborg, passing
    through a number of towns and villages, eventually including Helsinki, which is
    younger than this road (Helsinki was established in 1550).  The route extended to the
    west across the Baltic Sea, through Åland Islands into Stockholm and Bergen, and to the
    east towards Swedish fortresses of Kexholm and Nyenskans, before the latter was destroyed
    and replaced with St. Petersburg by Peter the Great. </p>
    
<p>The ancient road very approximately matches 
    modern E18 Route, which in Finland includes Roads 7 and 1, and Helsinki Ring III, but of course
    road alignment changed many times over the centuries.  Almost the entirety of the modern
    route is a motorway; older Roads 7 and 1 still exist as Roads 170 and 110, parallel
    to the new ones.  But even these roads are relatively modern, built in 1960s when the
    mass construction of the national road network of Finland took place.  Road 170/7 in Hamina and Virolahti
    was constructed in 1966; before that, the only road was the ancient King's Road, way
    more narrow and curvy.  The King's Road stretch in Virolahti has since been known
    as Yhdystie 3513 <i>(Finn.  Connecting Road)</i>.  Which is the road you can see in the picture.</p>
    
<p>Road 3513 is 35 km long, one of the longest of Finnish museum roads
    <i>(Museotie)</i>.  Museum roads not always correspond to tourist routes; usually
    this moniker is assigned to very old roads preserving their historical alignment.
    It doesn't mean there's necessarily much to see along this road.  It's certainly 
    the case for Road 3513; apart from stone kilometer markers, which can be seen on more
    modern roads too, it looks fairly ordinary.  In particular, it is completely paved;
    don't expect to see ancient flagstones or anything of the sort.  The only hint of 
    history is the narrowness and the bendyness of this road; its speed limit is 60 km/h
    and some bends are uncomfortable even at this speed.  As expected, traffic is very low.</p>
    
<p>Modern King's Road tourist route continues on westwards beyond Road 3513 on more modern roads.
    Currently it is probably the best known tourist route of Finland.  The map of all tourist routes
    is available <a target="_blank" href="http://autoliitto-fi-bin.directo.fi/@Bin/4c6275625bb81cd2ac56e2f68e4b45d4/1458733980/application/pdf/3245794/SuomenMatkailutiet.pdf">here</a>, although I'm not sure whether this is an official
    source.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/780/21436320676_4183524088_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/780/21436320676_53ba7d3df8_c.jpg 1x, https://farm1.staticflickr.com/780/21436320676_f5ac433884_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="533" alt="4" title="Klamila Harbor" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>4. The most significant village on the museum road is named Klamila.  Located near a small bay,
    its harbor is quiet but somewhat larger than you would expect.  This is the easternmost 
    Finnish port accepting international vessels.</p>  
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/687/20841465503_130c772eab_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/687/20841465503_78832c6631_c.jpg 1x, https://farm1.staticflickr.com/687/20841465503_40a699cb2d_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="532" alt="5" title="Pointers" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>5. These signs in Klamila point not towards Moscow, Tokyo, Paris, London, and other world capitals,
    as such signs usually do, but rather towards neighboring villages and other places of interest. </p>
    
<p><i>Säkkijärvi</i>, <i>Viipuri</i>, <i>Koivisto</i>, and <i>Terijoki</i> refer to towns now belonging
to Russia, and named Kondratyevo <i>(after Col. Pyotr Kondratyev, a Russian fighter wing commander,
    who fought over Karelian Isthmus in Winter War and Continuation War, and was shot down there in 1943)</i>
    Vyborg, Primorsk <i>(Russ. Seaside Town)</i>, and Zelenogorsk <i>(Russ. Green Mountains Town)</i>. 
    <i>Venäjän Raja</i> means Russian border.</p>
    
<p>Other interesting places mentioned are <i>Seiskari</i>, <i>Narvi</i> (not to be confused with
Narva the Estonian city), <i>Lavansaari</i>, <i>Tytärsaari</i>, <i>Suursaari</i> and a few others.
All of these are relatively isolated islands scattered in the middle of the Gulf of Finland, 
far out of the view of the coast.  They used to hold some Finnish villages, but all of them went
to the Soviet Union after the war (even the ones located significantly westwards of the land border),
and are now uninhabited except for border stations, lighthouses, and possibly some military
installations.</p>

<p>Lavansaari in particular (now known as Moschny <i>(Russ. Powerful)</i> Island) was the location
of the outermost Soviet naval base on the Baltic Sea during most of the 1941-1945 war.  I remember
this well because of <i>Sekretny Farvater</i> <i>(Russ. Secret Channel)</i> novel, which is in my
opinion one of the best books about that war.  It is set around the (fictionary) modern so-called "Flying Dutchman",
a secret Nazi submarine, perfectly ordinary but tasked with missions to set up clandestine 
trade relations between Nazi Germany and neutral and even Allied nations.  In 1944, a Soviet torpedo boat
commander, stationed at Lavensaari and regularly sent on minelaying and reconnaissance missions in
the skerry guards between Vyborg and Virolahti, accidentally discovers an unusually well-fortified
and disguised harbor in the skerries; Dolgy Kamen (Pitkäpaasi) island is mentioned, which places this harbor
in an archipelago just to the east of Virolahti.  From this harbor, serving as one of the 
bases for that "Flying Dutchman" submarine, its trail begins to unravel.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/631/21274725688_18a5f27767_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/631/21274725688_4a4c764269_c.jpg 1x, https://farm1.staticflickr.com/631/21274725688_2b3e9e60d5_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="532" alt="6" title="Torpedo" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>6. Coincidentally, the Finnish torpedo boat flotilla in the war happened to be stationed
    right here in Klamila.  A torpedo reminds here of the fact.  Curiously, in that <i>Sekrenty
        Farvater</i> book, the enemies are uniformly referred to as "fascists", although apart
        from the "Flying Dutchman" submarine crew, most of them were in fact Finnish, at least
    in the first half of the book set here in the Gulf of Finland.  Apart from the episode
    with a Finnish fighter shot down over the sea (because the nationality of its pilot becomes
    a plot point), there are virtually no references to the fact that the Finnish were another
    distinct side in this war. 
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5764/21471132791_6dff1a5908_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5764/21471132791_fd38d4ce70_c.jpg 1x, https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5764/21471132791_2ef7716144_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="532" alt="7" title="Mines" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>7. Along with a torpedo, there are two mines.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5661/21451592312_22797c949b_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5661/21451592312_a28230a743_c.jpg 1x, https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5661/21451592312_15401f994c_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="533" alt="8" title="Klamila" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>8. A small bay west of Klamila harbor.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/739/20841482733_8f9476292c_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/739/20841482733_8cc28a7c01_c.jpg 1x, https://farm1.staticflickr.com/739/20841482733_516be11110_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="532" alt="9" title="Birdwatching tower" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>9. Southeast of Hamina, near the end of the museum road section, there is a birdwatching
    tower.  Such birdwatching towers seem to be relatively common in Finland.  It seems a little 
    surreal that someone (the government presumably) goes to the length of building a small
    wooden tower and a fairly big parking lot just so some Finns can go birdwatching. 
</p>

<p>This tower is located in Hamina Municipality already, but birdwatching is specifically
    noted as a local attraction in Virolahti.  As I understand, migratory birds commonly
    make a stop in Virolahti area when going from the south to the north, in late May.
    There are even some <a target="_blank" href="http://www.arktikavirolahti.fi/in-english">Arctic Days</a>
    held yearly to celebrate the event.</p> 

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/773/20839888794_dc9dc1b989_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/773/20839888794_aae0feb6e6_c.jpg 1x, https://farm1.staticflickr.com/773/20839888794_c6a8870e62_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="532" alt="10" title="Dragonfly" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>10. Apart from birds information boards near the tower mention some dragonflies, and
    indeed I saw a few dragonflies sunbathing on the wooden handrails.
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5670/21274547250_2584821c3a_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5670/21274547250_6e5dc0daa4_c.jpg 1x, https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5670/21274547250_5cb3fe371f_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="532" alt="11" title="Vilniementie" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>11. The tower is located near a bay separating Hamina from Vilniemi, a village
    where Pitkäthiekat Camping is located.  The narrowest part of the bay is called
    Lauttasalmi <i>(Finn. Ferry Strait)</i>.  Presumably there once was a ferry crossing
    in place of this bridge.
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5731/21471170691_c221686be1_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5731/21471170691_9bb385ba2d_c.jpg 1x, https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5731/21471170691_e68e33d1ce_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="532" alt="12" title="Bay" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>12. The view from the birdwatching tower.  I looked around with my binoculars (which I carry
    around in my car but very rarely remember to actually use) and actually happened to spot
    a large predatory-looking bird on a rock in the middle of this picture, an eagle maybe;
    I'm extremely ignorant about ornithology.  I failed to capture this bird in any pictures though.
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5827/21471646711_550c4d807a_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5827/21471646711_ecac3bfc9d_c.jpg 1x, https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5827/21471646711_da6094b14f_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="532" alt="13" title="Pitkäthiekat Camping cabins" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>13. I booked a tiny cabin in Pitkäthiekat Camping, costing &euro;40/night.  
    This was not the tiniest cabin I've ever been into; it had four beds,
    a window, and a microwave oven with a tiny freezer; the tiniest cabin
    in Rauhalahti Camping in Kuopio, for example, didn't even have that.  
    While the lack of toilet and shower is inconvenient, I still love such
    tiny cabins.   
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/605/21452109192_6a49238cb3_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/605/21452109192_ac71df8252_c.jpg 1x, https://farm1.staticflickr.com/605/21452109192_4795e8bf21_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="532" alt="14" title="Virolahti bagels" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>14. Apart from some cider, which I traditionally buy and drink whenever
    I go to Finland (for some reason they have a much broader assortment of cider
    than most Russian supermarkets), I spotted some "Virolahti bagels" in a Hamina
    supermarket, and couldn't resist buying some.  Pretty basic bagels. </p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/699/21275239158_4fe7c70a93_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/699/21275239158_ba41126cb9_c.jpg 1x, https://farm1.staticflickr.com/699/21275239158_99fe17f476_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="532" alt="15" title="Pitkäthiekat Camping" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>15. Pitkäthiekat means "Long Sands", and the camping indeed stretches along a long sandy beach
    on the coast of the Gulf of Finland.  
</p>

<p>20. My attempt at night photography from a tripod was not particularly successful.
    Manual focus on the cheap 18-55 Nikon lens doesn't really work.

<p>21. Same camping in the morning.  Due to the proximity to the border, it seemed
    about a half of the guests were Russian (judging by car license plates).  By midnight though
    all I could hear were loud sounds of Finnish karaoke from the restaurant (building to the right)
    which happened to be fairly close to my cabin.  Good thing I don't really mind noise when
    falling asleep.

<p>25. The karaoke restaurant in the morning.  With that, I departed this camping for Kotka.
    And now in the next post we'll return one day earlier, to my visit to the Salpa Line Museum
    in Miehikkälä.
