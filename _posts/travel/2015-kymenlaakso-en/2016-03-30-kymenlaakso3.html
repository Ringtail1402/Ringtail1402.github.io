<p>The town of&nbsp;<b>Hamina</b>, located in&nbsp;about 35&nbsp;km from the Russian border, has population
of&nbsp;only about 21,000 (10,000&nbsp;if you discount suburbs and villages), but as&nbsp;far as&nbsp;smallish
Finnish towns&nbsp;go, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;very cool one, thanks to&nbsp;its unusual city plan. Hamina is&nbsp;a&nbsp;fortress town,
with fortress-like octagonal planning and surrounding bastions and ramparts still preserved
to&nbsp;this day.</p>

<p>The place which later became Hamina was historically known as&nbsp;Vehkalahti <i>(Finn. Calla Bay,
after a&nbsp;flower)</i>, and indeed Vehkalahti Municipality with a&nbsp;calla flower on&nbsp;its coat of&nbsp;arms
still existed near Hamina up&nbsp;until their merger in&nbsp;2003. Villages in&nbsp;Vehkalahti existed
since the Middle Ages, and in&nbsp;1653 Vehkalahti <i>kirkonkyl&auml;</i> (church village) was promoted to&nbsp;a&nbsp;town,
unimaginatively named Vehkalahden Uusikaupunki <i>(Finn. Vehkalahti New Town; not to&nbsp;be
confused with a&nbsp;city named simply Uusikaupunki, to&nbsp;the north of&nbsp;Turku)</i>. 1653&nbsp;is thus
considered the year of&nbsp;Hamina founding, which makes Hamina the oldest Kymenlaakso city.</p>

<p>Vehkalahden Uusikaupunki was a&nbsp;fairly insignificant town up&nbsp;until the Great Northern War of
1700-1721. The town got burned down to&nbsp;the ground in&nbsp;1712, but after the war it&nbsp;became a&nbsp;border
town, and thus got rebuilt as&nbsp;a&nbsp;fortress. It&nbsp;was renamed into Fredrikshamn <i>(Swed. Frederick
Harbor)</i> in&nbsp;1723, after King Frederick I&nbsp;of&nbsp;Sweden, who succeeded warmongering Charles XII.
Fredrikshamn remains the official Swedish name of&nbsp;the city, but in&nbsp;Finnish it&nbsp;became known
as&nbsp;simply Hamina, &ldquo;the harbor&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Fredrikshamn was redesigned by&nbsp;Duke Axel L&ouml;wen, a&nbsp;notable Swedish military commander and
fortifications engineer. It&nbsp;became a&nbsp;star-shaped fortress, with an&nbsp;octagonal city core
among sharp bastions; a&nbsp;fairly rare design for a&nbsp;full-fledged city.
Apart from the military significance, Fredrikshamn became an&nbsp;important
seaport for border trade with Russia&nbsp;&mdash; a&nbsp;role which had been fulfilled by&nbsp;Vyborg before.
(The new border of&nbsp;1721 in&nbsp;Southeastern Finland approximately matched the modern
post-WWII&nbsp;border, leaving Virolahti and Lappeenranta to&nbsp;Swedish Finland, 
and Vyborg and Kexholm to&nbsp;Russia.)</p>

<p>Still, Fredrikshamn didn&rsquo;t last too long in&nbsp;that role too. In&nbsp;the next Russo-Swedish war
of&nbsp;1741-1743 (known as&nbsp;Hat&rsquo;s War in&nbsp;Finland, as&nbsp;also as&nbsp;Lesser Wrath, as&nbsp;opposed to&nbsp;the
Greater Wrath of&nbsp;1700-1721) Russia ended up&nbsp;annexing another chunk of&nbsp;Finland, including
Savonlinna, Lappeenranta (Vilmanstrand), and Fredrikshamn. Together with Vyborg and Kexholm,
this area became known as&nbsp;Old Finland. The role of&nbsp;the next border
town passed on&nbsp;to&nbsp;Loviisa, which also became the new home for most Fredrikshamn Swedes.</p>

<p>As&nbsp;we&nbsp;all know Loviisa and its fortress of&nbsp;Svartholm eventually also proved unsuccessful
in&nbsp;repelling Russia, and by&nbsp;1809 Russia annexed Finland entirely. The peacy treaty
confirming this was signed right here in&nbsp;Fredrikshamn. Old Finland was
rejoined to&nbsp;the rest of&nbsp;Finland, and in&nbsp;effect ended up&nbsp;having greater autonomy than 
in&nbsp;the 18th century.</p>

<p>By&nbsp;the second half of&nbsp;the 19th century, Hamina was somewhat overshadowed by&nbsp;its neighboring city
of&nbsp;Kotka, growing on&nbsp;the site of&nbsp;former Russian Ruotsinsalmi fortress, destroyed by
the British in&nbsp;the Crimean War. Modern Kotka and Hamina, spaced just 25&nbsp;km apart,
are highly integrated together. Hamina-Kotka seaport is&nbsp;the most important seaport of&nbsp;all
Finland, although a&nbsp;large share of&nbsp;its imports was transit cargo for Russia, which is&nbsp;on&nbsp;a
severe decline due both to&nbsp;the Russian economic crisis, and to&nbsp;the delopment of&nbsp;Russia&rsquo;s
own seaports in&nbsp;the vicinity of&nbsp;St. Petersburg. The seaport is&nbsp;probably the most important
Hamina enterprise; another major one was a&nbsp;Stora Enso paper mill in&nbsp;the suburb of&nbsp;Summa, 
which shut down in&nbsp;2008. The old factory was then bought by&nbsp;none other than Google,
which established a&nbsp;large modern data center in&nbsp;its industrial buildings. It&nbsp;seems this
data center is&nbsp;physically the closest one to&nbsp;St. Petersburg, and&nbsp;I wonder if&nbsp;it&nbsp;means
that whenever I&nbsp;Google something, the request goes to&nbsp;Hamina servers. It&rsquo;s probably
more complicated than that.</p>

<p>As&nbsp;one more random note, <a target="_blank" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Hamina.vaakuna.svg/240px-Hamina.vaakuna.svg.png">Hamina coat of&nbsp;arms</a>
is&nbsp;extremely similar to&nbsp;the <a target="_blank" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Helsinki.vaakuna.svg/498px-Helsinki.vaakuna.svg.png">Helsinki one</a>. Both picture a&nbsp;wooden boat floating on&nbsp;the waves, with a&nbsp;king&rsquo;s crown
above. Apparently the crown in&nbsp;the Helsinki coat of&nbsp;arms is&nbsp;styled like Gustav Vasa&rsquo;s crown,
and the Hamina one is&nbsp;more like the crown of&nbsp;Frederick I. In&nbsp;other words both are Swedish
crowns which match the era when the corresponding city was established.</p>

<p>I&nbsp;drove to&nbsp;Hamina after exploring the Salpa Line Museum and taking the museum King&rsquo;s Road
through Virolahti. I&nbsp;left my&nbsp;car at&nbsp;a&nbsp;parking lot at&nbsp;the market square. (How do&nbsp;you distinguish
a&nbsp;small Finnish city from a&nbsp;medium-sized Finnish city? The small one doesn&rsquo;t have tolled
parking.) Apart from this square, with elderly Finns walking out of&nbsp;the supermarkets with
grocery bags, teenagers hanging around, and peaceful drunks, well, being peaceful drunks, 
the rest of&nbsp;the city was extremely quiet and seemed almost deserted in&nbsp;a&nbsp;beautiful sunny
Saturday evening. I&nbsp;had a&nbsp;nice long walk around the entire town (which took me&nbsp;all of&nbsp;two hours)
and enjoyed it&nbsp;to a&nbsp;degree unusual even for me, with my well-known love for Finland.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5767/21274774878_9d25e80775_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5767/21274774878_13b9819385_c.jpg 1x, https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5767/21274774878_1c8555286f_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="532" alt="1" title="City Hall" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>1. The market square borders the octagonal core of&nbsp;the town, which consists of&nbsp;two ring streets,
eight radial streets, and a&nbsp;round square with the old city hall (1798) right in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;it&nbsp;all.
I&nbsp;think the actual city administration is&nbsp;now located elsewhere. 
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/700/20839926584_4e3f615ff8_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/700/20839926584_705508399f_c.jpg 1x, https://farm1.staticflickr.com/700/20839926584_c0862a6de5_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="532" alt="2" title="Church of St. Peter and St. Paul" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>2. Orthodox Church of&nbsp;St. Peter and St. Paul (1837) on&nbsp;the central square looks very Russian in&nbsp;style.
It&nbsp;would not look the tiniest bit out of&nbsp;place in&nbsp;any random minor Russian town.
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5740/21275722339_0c513615c6_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5740/21275722339_f32c97bc58_c.jpg 1x, https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5740/21275722339_d23ee6c097_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="532" alt="3" title="Building on central square" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>3. A&nbsp;pretty wooden building on&nbsp;the same square, I&rsquo;m not sure about its purpose.
The square by&nbsp;the way is&nbsp;called Raatihuoneentori <i>(Finn. literally City Hall Square)</i>.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/673/20841538423_5772c0fe3f_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/673/20841538423_80d02c4ff0_c.jpg 1x, https://farm1.staticflickr.com/673/20841538423_194af3e8b6_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="533" alt="4" title="St. John's Church" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>4. And yet another building at&nbsp;Raatihuoneentori, St. John&rsquo;s Church (1843). It&nbsp;is&nbsp;an
ordinary Finnish Lutheran church, but it&nbsp;actually looks kind of&nbsp;Russian in&nbsp;style too. 
It&nbsp;lacks a&nbsp;dome of&nbsp;course, but then there are some old Russian churches which had their domes
dismantled in&nbsp;Soviet years.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/706/20839938644_6a90b7bf66_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/706/20839938644_a802366f48_c.jpg 1x, https://farm1.staticflickr.com/706/20839938644_f79da04ec2_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="532" alt="5" title="Raatihuoneentori" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>5. Some family shops.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/590/20841544193_e6588011d8_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/590/20841544193_fc13f82cbe_c.jpg 1x, https://farm1.staticflickr.com/590/20841544193_3455b4e4fc_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="532" alt="6" title="Raatihuoneentori" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>6. </p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/752/21274598070_f9c7a104d8_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/752/21274598070_f5543bdd47_c.jpg 1x, https://farm1.staticflickr.com/752/21274598070_bc35d17f6f_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="532" alt="7" title="Ring street" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>7. One of&nbsp;the ring streets. The old octagonal city center is&nbsp;fairly small, probably
just about half a&nbsp;kilometer across. </p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5628/21274810648_dae777b40a_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5628/21274810648_3d6f1b8233_c.jpg 1x, https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5628/21274810648_a93c17206a_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="533" alt="8" title="Hamina Bastion" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>8. And just beyond the octagonal built-up area are old bastions of&nbsp;the Hamina Fortress:
high triangle-shaped earth ramparts. 
There are six of&nbsp;them, named after Finnish cities. This is&nbsp;the largest one, the Hamina Bastion;
it&nbsp;replaced an&nbsp;older part of&nbsp;the fortress in&nbsp;the 19th century to&nbsp;protect it&nbsp;from the north. 
Helsinki Bastion to&nbsp;the south of&nbsp;the fortress didn&rsquo;t survive to&nbsp;this day at&nbsp;all;
the market square now more or&nbsp;less takes it&nbsp;place. The huge Hamina Bastion however has been
preserved, and turned into a&nbsp;concert venue, covered with an&nbsp;enormous tent. 
</p>

<p>It&nbsp;is&nbsp;of&nbsp;course quite notable by&nbsp;itself that a&nbsp;20,000-large town actually has built such a&nbsp;huge arena.
It&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t get many world stars, of&nbsp;course, but still there were for example Scorpions,
in&nbsp;July 2015.  The bastion is also used as the&nbsp;main venue for the&nbsp;yearly Hamina Tattoo 
festival, devoted to military music.
Note also the rows of&nbsp;doors leading inside of&nbsp;the rampart. I&nbsp;believe there are
some cafeterias and the like there in&nbsp;summer.</p> 

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/658/20841559723_0ef520144c_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/658/20841559723_0aace902fe_c.jpg 1x, https://farm1.staticflickr.com/658/20841559723_784893f188_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="532" alt="9" title="Hamina Bastion" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>9. I&nbsp;walked the length of&nbsp;the rampart, enjoying evening sun and quiet. There was literally no&nbsp;one
in&nbsp;sight.
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5666/21436434686_4acae1dc60_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5666/21436434686_e24878af9c_c.jpg 1x, https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5666/21436434686_360be9c37d_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="532" alt="10" title="Sports field" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>10. Beyond the ramparts are some sports fields, and that&rsquo;s all; the city ends here. Farther&nbsp;to 
    the&nbsp;north is a&nbsp;large swamp; actually the&nbsp;overgrown Kirkkojärvi lake.  Hamina stretches much more in&nbsp;other directions, transitioning
into typical Finnish suburbia. 
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/708/21274644000_f92f38a99c_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/708/21274644000_c3cc0accae_c.jpg 1x, https://farm1.staticflickr.com/708/21274644000_d81561011e_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="532" alt="11" title="Hamina Bastion" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>11. </p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/681/21274648050_e9d07167a2_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/681/21274648050_4c0502fdf0_c.jpg 1x, https://farm1.staticflickr.com/681/21274648050_0533dfb8b2_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="533" alt="12" title="" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>12. Star fort type fortifications are usually fairly unimpressive-looking. Medieval fortresses look 
much cooler (they are what we&nbsp;imagine when we&nbsp;think about fortresses and castles), but they ended
up&nbsp;faring poorly against cannons. Finland has only a&nbsp;few medieval castles, but quite a&nbsp;lot of
16th-18th era fortresses, which shows that the country fully developed much later that Sweden
or&nbsp;continental powers. Still, Hamina fortress is&nbsp;among the more visually interesting ones.
Apart from the ring of&nbsp;bastions, it&nbsp;also has some detached ravelins. 
</p>

<p>13. Football field between a&nbsp;bastion and a&nbsp;ravelin. A&nbsp;lone girl walks on&nbsp;the running tracks.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/718/21436476506_1f706a3d5a_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/718/21436476506_bf01d9bb0b_c.jpg 1x, https://farm1.staticflickr.com/718/21436476506_dfd9bba2a7_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="532" alt="14" title="Hämeenlinna Bastion" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>14. The smaller bastion to&nbsp;the west of&nbsp;Hamina Bastion is&nbsp;named after H&auml;meenlinna. There is&nbsp;a
gunpowder cellar in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;it.  It serves as an art gallery.
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5803/20840014884_13a52c4221_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5803/20840014884_54cf2e630d_c.jpg 1x, https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5803/20840014884_f6e2ede1a3_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="532" alt="15" title="Hämeenlinna Bastion" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>15. Cozy houses beyond the bastion.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5747/20841631033_04fb51cd3f_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5747/20841631033_249cce96c7_c.jpg 1x, https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5747/20841631033_89d86cd0d6_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="532" alt="16" title="Hämeenlinna Bastion" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>16. You can actually walk under the rampart through the unlocked gate.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/644/20840031764_c8441d6860_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/644/20840031764_81800e4f69_c.jpg 1x, https://farm1.staticflickr.com/644/20840031764_6537458bfe_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="532" alt="17" title="Under rampart" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>17. The corridor is&nbsp;fairly clean as&nbsp;far as&nbsp;such places&nbsp;go. It&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t even stink of&nbsp;piss.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/679/20840042524_e1414fb7fc_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/679/20840042524_3fc9d0c1fc_c.jpg 1x, https://farm1.staticflickr.com/679/20840042524_17b1417e84_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="532" alt="18" title="City park" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>18. The next bastion, Lappeenranta Bastion I&nbsp;think, was turned into a&nbsp;lush city park. The rampart
itself is&nbsp;dwarfed by&nbsp;the trees. This is&nbsp;the last bastion of&nbsp;the three open to&nbsp;the public; 
the other three (named after Turku, Savonlinna, and Hamina; the latter one shares its name with the&nbsp;newer large bastion we have seen before) are a&nbsp;restricted military area, but we&rsquo;ll see a&nbsp;bit of&nbsp;them later.
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/673/20841658393_43dba77787_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/673/20841658393_acac1f3c77_c.jpg 1x, https://farm1.staticflickr.com/673/20841658393_efd02ecd21_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="532" alt="19" title="City park" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>19. There is&nbsp;a&nbsp;nice small pond in&nbsp;the park. The bastion wall is&nbsp;visible in&nbsp;the background. </p>


<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5807/21274931318_43067eb72a_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5807/21274931318_e511921377_c.jpg 1x, https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5807/21274931318_6dca9f1278_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="532" alt="20" title="City park" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>20. </p>

<p>21. There is&nbsp;a&nbsp;small statue of&nbsp;a&nbsp;seal next to&nbsp;the pond.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5737/20840059554_3f71944805_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5737/20840059554_9101e9d1d0_c.jpg 1x, https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5737/20840059554_e7615b573f_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="532" alt="22" title="Guardhouse" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>22. An&nbsp;old guardhouse at&nbsp;the road to&nbsp;the west. It&nbsp;reminds me&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;old post houses on&nbsp;the

<p>23. Hamina bus station. The large wooden building used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;railway station as&nbsp;well;
old Inkeroinen-Hamina line, built in&nbsp;1899, led past this station to&nbsp;old Hamina port at&nbsp;Tervasaari.
The port eventually moved from Tervasaari to&nbsp;a&nbsp;much larger peninsula to&nbsp;the west of&nbsp;the city, handling
all kinds of&nbsp;cargo there. The old railroad was dismantled and replaced by&nbsp;a&nbsp;new
Juurikorpi-Hamina Harbor line in&nbsp;1984, and passenger service was terminated.

<p>24. The Park House (1884), a&nbsp;beautiful wooden house next to&nbsp;the park. Originally a&nbsp;hotel, it&nbsp;is
now used by&nbsp;a&nbsp;music school.

<p>25. Another wooden building nearby is&nbsp;a&nbsp;Sobriety House. Sobriety Association was a&nbsp;thing
back in&nbsp;the 19th century (or&nbsp;maybe it&nbsp;still&nbsp;is?). The building is&nbsp;now used by&nbsp;a&nbsp;theater.

<p>26. Back on&nbsp;the market square. A&nbsp;supermarket of&nbsp;the ubiquitous S-Market chain looks a&nbsp;bit
out of&nbsp;place after the wooden buildings. </p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/629/20841739023_b06e3b017b_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/629/20841739023_bee889acae_c.jpg 1x, https://farm1.staticflickr.com/629/20841739023_ca05fc5974_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="532" alt="27" title="Market square" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>27. The octagonal plan of&nbsp;Hamina is&nbsp;clearly visible in&nbsp;the picture on&nbsp;an&nbsp;information
board. I&nbsp;also like the logo they came up&nbsp;with for Russian tourists; Hamina is&nbsp;spelled <i>Хамина</i>
in&nbsp;Russian, and they turned the&nbsp;<i>Х</i> letter into a&nbsp;heart. Too bad that doesn&rsquo;t work with
<i>H</i>&nbsp;letter in&nbsp;Finnish/English. </p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5784/21436620516_259024fee5_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5784/21436620516_18aae6a9a8_c.jpg 1x, https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5784/21436620516_0b26b8e8c9_h.jpg 2x" width="532" height="800" alt="28" title="Flag Tower" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>28. Let&rsquo;s go&nbsp;to&nbsp;another side of&nbsp;the city. Close to&nbsp;the market square is&nbsp;the Flag Tower (<i>Lipputorni</i>;
1790), at&nbsp;the location of&nbsp;the former Helsinki Bastion. For some reason&nbsp;I was certain
that the Peace Treaty of&nbsp;Fredrikshamn of&nbsp;1809 was signed in&nbsp;this very tower (maybe&nbsp;I read
that somewhere?), and&nbsp;I was surprised and a&nbsp;bit disappointed when&nbsp;I failed to&nbsp;find any
sign mentioning that. It&nbsp;turns out the treaty was actually signed in&nbsp;the governor&rsquo;s house, which was
eventually dismantled and replaced by&nbsp;the St.&nbsp;John&rsquo;s Church; and there is&nbsp;indeed a&nbsp;small memorial
here, which&nbsp;I never noticed.
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5705/21436614826_dee2e7dd0d_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5705/21436614826_1e83033a04_c.jpg 1x, https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5705/21436614826_8d670eabec_h.jpg 2x" width="532" height="800" alt="29" title="Pesäpallo player" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>29. Next to&nbsp;the Flag Tower is&nbsp;a&nbsp;statue of&nbsp;a&nbsp;boy apparently playing baseball. 
Actually it&nbsp;is&nbsp;not American baseball, but rather <i>pes&auml;pallo</i>, an&nbsp;obscure game endemic to&nbsp;Finland.
Pes&auml;pallo is&nbsp;indeed inspired by&nbsp;baseball, but it&nbsp;is&nbsp;simplified and made more dynamic.

<p>30. Large apartment blocks are relatively rare in&nbsp;Hamina. This is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the newer ones,
with an&nbsp;indoor swimming pool.
</p>

<p>31. Labor Union House. Notice the octagon motive on&nbsp;the pediment. The Hamina octagon is&nbsp;also used in
logos of&nbsp;some of&nbsp;the local businesses.

<p>33. Hamina motorway bypass was finished only in&nbsp;2014. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;fairly short section of&nbsp;National Road&nbsp;7,
but it&nbsp;includes four interchanges, two tunnels, and various bridges. Before 2014 Road 7&nbsp;passed 
through the built-up part of&nbsp;Hamina as&nbsp;an&nbsp;ordinary trunk street, forming the southern border of
Hamina center. The old road has been reclassified into Regional Road 170, joining the rest of
old non-motorway sections of&nbsp;Road&nbsp;7. 
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/718/20841804953_e18fa2bd3e_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/718/20841804953_90ca5ee863_c.jpg 1x, https://farm1.staticflickr.com/718/20841804953_03d82bbf6e_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="532" alt="34" title="Sea" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>34. Despite the proximity of&nbsp;the sea and the very name of&nbsp;the city, Hamina (unlike Kotka)
is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;those cities
where you are actually rather unlikely to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;glimpse of&nbsp;the water, unless you know
where exactly to&nbsp;go&nbsp;and what to&nbsp;look for. Personally I&nbsp;only managed to&nbsp;find this small yacht harbor,
and even then&nbsp;I had to&nbsp;cross Road 170 and to&nbsp;walk across a&nbsp;large truck parking area with
lots of&nbsp;Russian and Bulgarian semis. There is&nbsp;a&nbsp;passenger harbor at&nbsp;the former port at
Tervasaari, with a&nbsp;few museum ships, and regular service to&nbsp;the island of&nbsp;Ulko-Tammio, located
in&nbsp;just a&nbsp;few kilometers from Russian waters. Ulko-Tammio is&nbsp;a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;the Gulf of&nbsp;Finland
National Park, which includes a&nbsp;range of&nbsp;beautiful small islands and skerries in&nbsp;the vicinity
of&nbsp;Kotka and Hamina. Most of&nbsp;these islands can only be&nbsp;reached by&nbsp;a&nbsp;private boat. </p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5692/20840217364_a2cbd2884b_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5692/20840217364_39d32bef92_c.jpg 1x, https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5692/20840217364_28f749215f_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="532" alt="35" title="Guardhouse" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>35. Back in&nbsp;central Hamina. Another old guardhouse.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/615/21451945502_12b4b8af58_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/615/21451945502_1d3271e4b4_c.jpg 1x, https://farm1.staticflickr.com/615/21451945502_4cef5db88a_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="532" alt="36" title="Old barracks" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>36. The eastern part of&nbsp;the city, including three of&nbsp;the old bastions, is&nbsp;occupied by&nbsp;the military,
including, most importantly, the Reserve Officer School <i>(Reserviupseerikoulu, RUK)</i>. The School, founded in&nbsp;1920,
is&nbsp;an&nbsp;important part of&nbsp;Finnish Defence Forces. Finland has mandatory conscription for all males
(and volunteer service for females; 12&nbsp;month long non-military service can also be&nbsp;chosen instead,
but this is&nbsp;relatively uncommon), which normally lasts 6-12 months (more if&nbsp;the conscript
ends up&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;role demanding more training and skills). After some weeks of&nbsp;basic training,
some conscripts are selected to&nbsp;be&nbsp;trained as&nbsp;NCOs, and after some NCO training, some of&nbsp;these
conscripts are further selected and sent to&nbsp;this Reserve Officer School in&nbsp;Hamina. Here they
study for 3.5&nbsp;months, and then return back to&nbsp;their original units as&nbsp;commanders. The overall
service for reserve officers always lasts 12&nbsp;months (347 days to&nbsp;be&nbsp;precise), and then they are
discharged in&nbsp;the rank of&nbsp;second lieutenant. Reserve Officer School currently releases about
700&nbsp;officers, twice a&nbsp;year (since universal conscription takes place twice a&nbsp;year). 
</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll see the main building of&nbsp;the School a&nbsp;bit later, and these are just some old brick
barracks on&nbsp;the nearby streets.   Despite the fact that the school should be&nbsp;inactive in&nbsp;September (the courses start in&nbsp;mid-October), I&nbsp;actually saw quite a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;young blond
square-jawed men, wearing green uniforms, walking around Hamina. One of&nbsp;them was even carrying a&nbsp;bag
of&nbsp;apples. Too bad&nbsp;I never got a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;picture of&nbsp;them, although they were so&nbsp;photogenic that
I&nbsp;actually was tempted just to&nbsp;ask one of&nbsp;them to&nbsp;pose for a&nbsp;picture (something that&nbsp;I have never
ever done).</p>

<p>39. These bastions and the gravel road between them are also Reserve Officer School territory.
Kadettikoulunkatu street <i>(Finn. Cadet School Street)</i> passed over them on&nbsp;a&nbsp;bridge.
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/642/20841852603_a407134a71_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/642/20841852603_90474c5edc_c.jpg 1x, https://farm1.staticflickr.com/642/20841852603_af2dd4451d_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="532" alt="40" title="Varvara" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>40. A&nbsp;very touching monument to&nbsp;some Varvara Schantin, a&nbsp;Russian <i>babushka</i> who sold
buns to&nbsp;the School students for twenty years until her death in&nbsp;1941. For many of&nbsp;them she
was a&nbsp;sort of&nbsp;a&nbsp;mother figure, someone to&nbsp;trust in&nbsp;this town far from home. The monument
was installed in&nbsp;1972, and financed by&nbsp;the former students of&nbsp;the School. Apparently there
is&nbsp;also a&nbsp;legend that she was a&nbsp;lover of&nbsp;Mannerheim, which is&nbsp;completely false and absurd.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/597/21462961475_f932c8e740_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/597/21462961475_e47b129f1a_c.jpg 1x, https://farm1.staticflickr.com/597/21462961475_f2d1d2a8df_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="532" alt="41" title="Aili" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>41. And this is&nbsp;a&nbsp;German StuG III assault gun, the most numerous German tank destroyer
in&nbsp;the World War II. A&nbsp;total of&nbsp;59&nbsp;of&nbsp;these served in&nbsp;Finnish Armoured Division in&nbsp;1943-1944.
They were given female names, and this one, <i>Aili</i>, in&nbsp;particular was quite successful,
with seven confirmed kills against Soviet T-34s in&nbsp;the Battle of&nbsp;Tali-Ihantala in&nbsp;June-July 1944
(for some reason there are only five stripes on&nbsp;the barrel though).
The battle was a&nbsp;bloody one; the Finnish managed to&nbsp;stop Soviet counteroffensive near
Vyborg, thus preventing the Sovets from advancing into Finland. Peace talks soon followed.
The Finnish generally believe that the battles of&nbsp;Tali-Ihantala and of&nbsp;Ilomantsi were what
allowed them to&nbsp;keep their independence and prevent more territorial losses in&nbsp;the final
stages of&nbsp;the World War II. 
</p>

<p>Note the swastika. The information board to&nbsp;the left, instead of&nbsp;telling about the assault
gun itself, goes to&nbsp;great lengths to&nbsp;assure that the Nazi swastika is&nbsp;the bad one, and
the Finnish swastika is&nbsp;absolutely completely positively in&nbsp;no&nbsp;way related to&nbsp;it. This is 
actually true. The swastika <i>(hakaristi)</i> was used:</p>

<ul>
<li>by&nbsp;the Air Force, starting in&nbsp;1918; it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;personal symbol of&nbsp;Count Eric von Rosen,
who donated the first ever plane to&nbsp;Finland, which beared a&nbsp;blue swastika in&nbsp;white circle,
and Finland kept this insignia in&nbsp;his honor. Curiously, that Count von Rosen guy
actually did end up&nbsp;a&nbsp;Nazi sympathizer later, and even became a&nbsp;brother-in-law to&nbsp;G&ouml;ring.
The Air Force swastika is&nbsp;still used to&nbsp;this day, in&nbsp;a&nbsp;rather goofy winged version</li>
<li>by&nbsp;the Armoured Division, which used it&nbsp;only during the Continuation War of&nbsp;1941-1944.
I&rsquo;m not sure why it&nbsp;was adopted</li>
<li>by&nbsp;Lotta Sv&auml;rd, a&nbsp;volunteer paramilitary organization for women, which adopted the swastika
from the Air Force. Lotta Sv&auml;rd was banned after the war by&nbsp;Soviet Union&rsquo;s wishes</li>
<li>in&nbsp;the Order of&nbsp;the Cross of&nbsp;Liberty, highly stylized and still used</li>
</ul>

<p>42. The assault gun along with a&nbsp;few more less notable guns and tanks belong to&nbsp;the

<p>44. A&nbsp;small Orthodox chapel by&nbsp;the road. Another very Russian-looking construction.</p>

<p>45. And a&nbsp;much bigger one, looking like it&nbsp;has just been plucked from the middle of&nbsp;St. Petersburg.
This is&nbsp;the main building of&nbsp;the Reserve Officer School. The building was constructed in&nbsp;1898
for the School&rsquo;s predecessor, the Hamina Cadet School, which existed since 1820. Mannerheim
himself studied here for a&nbsp;while, but was expelled due to&nbsp;a&nbsp;disciplinary breach in&nbsp;1886. This was the reason
why he&nbsp;continued his military career in&nbsp;the Russian army as&nbsp;a&nbsp;Russian White officer, and returned
in&nbsp;Finland only after the revolution. The school itself was disbanded in&nbsp;1901, just a&nbsp;few
years after the construction of&nbsp;this building, as&nbsp;part of&nbsp;the Russification effort; Russia saw
no&nbsp;need for Finland to&nbsp;have its own army anymore. </p>

<p>46. The war memorial next to&nbsp;the building. The troops, for some reason having somewhat
mongoloid features, stare intensely towards the border.</p>

<p>47. Back in&nbsp;Hamina center. The third church in&nbsp;central Hamina doesn&rsquo;t face the City Hall, 
and in&nbsp;general looks rather plain. However this St. Mary&rsquo;s Church is&nbsp;actually the oldest
building in&nbsp;Hamina and in&nbsp;entire Kymenlaakso. It&nbsp;predates Hamina itself, built in&nbsp;the 15th
century as&nbsp;the central church of&nbsp;Vehkalahti. Sadly it&nbsp;didn&rsquo;t keep the original medieval look;
the church was badly damaged by&nbsp;a&nbsp;fire in&nbsp;1821, and rebuilt in&nbsp;1828. The original architect
of&nbsp;this church is&nbsp;unknown, remaining in&nbsp;history only as&nbsp;&ldquo;Pernaja Master&rdquo;; he&nbsp;probably was a
German. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;believed to&nbsp;have constructed a&nbsp;number of&nbsp;churches of&nbsp;similar design over the
15th century: Porvoo Cathedral, Church of&nbsp;St. Lawrence in&nbsp;Vantaa (the oldest building of
Greater Helsinki), Old Church in&nbsp;Sipoo (eastwards of&nbsp;Helsinki), Pernaja Church (in&nbsp;Loviisa),
 Pyht&auml;&auml; Church (westwards of&nbsp;Kotka), and this St. Mary&rsquo;s Church which ended up&nbsp;the worst
preserved one.

<p>49. And that&rsquo;s all. I&nbsp;got back to&nbsp;my&nbsp;car, bought some food and cider in&nbsp;a&nbsp;supermarket,
and drove to&nbsp;the nearby Pitk&auml;thiekat Camping which&nbsp;I already described before. I&nbsp;loved
Hamina; for now it&nbsp;remains my&nbsp;favorite small Finnish town. It&nbsp;has quite distinctive character,
unlike most small Finnish towns, and it&rsquo;s just the kind of&nbsp;town where you sometimes wish
you could live when you are tired of&nbsp;megapolises.

<p>The only remaining city in&nbsp;this trip is&nbsp;Kotka, which is&nbsp;larger, much less old and historical,
but much more sea-spirited. To&nbsp;be&nbsp;continued.</p>
