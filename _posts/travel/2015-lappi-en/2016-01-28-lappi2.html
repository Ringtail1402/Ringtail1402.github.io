<p>So what does a Lapland ski resort cabin look like?  I must say I was extremely impressed.
    This is the best accomodation I've ever had.  It is an actual home where a person or two
    could live indefinitely long.  (There are of course also more traditional hotels at Äkäslompolo,
    and there are larger cabins which accomodate more people.  Mine was on the smaller side.)

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/774/21939578776_c725e4930a_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/774/21939578776_930479b3d6_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="1" title="Cabin outside" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>1. The cabin is actually an apartment in a small row house, the middle one of three.
    Both outer apartments were not occupied.  The exterior walls appears to be built from logs.
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5702/21777666760_bb229d1df1_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5702/21777666760_6d081361c2_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="2" title="Kitchen corner" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>2. The cabin consists of a living room/kitchen, a bathroom, a sauna, and a mansard bedroom.
    With the exception of the bedroom, it would look a lot like a typical studio apartment.
</p>

<p>As you see, the kitchenette is furnished pretty much perfectly, with an electric stove, a large
    fridge, a dishwasher (I don't even know how to use these), and all the smaller stuff like
    a microwave oven or a toaster.  The cupboards contained an impressive amount of dishes, a bit
    too much for one or two people, really.  There wasn't much leftover food, just a bag of
    crispbreads.</p>
    
<p>The fireplace of course is largely why I decided to book this cabin at all.  I have never used
    a real fireplace, too.  There was a small pile of firewood available.  I decided to put off
    lighting it up until tomorrow

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5774/21939593716_af31011d30_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5774/21939593716_54a09d95a4_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="3" title="Couch corner" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>3. There was a large couch in the corner across the kitchen one.  It reminded me a lot
    of an Ikea couch I bought with my first bonus ever ages ago. </p>
    
<p>There were a few books at the coffee table, including yellow pages, tourist brochures,
    and two trashy-looking novels, one in English and one in Finnish.  There also was a guest book,
    a notebook with a picture of lighthouse, which I read through with great curiosity.  The book
    started in the end of 2011 (I found the previous volume in some cupboard later), and a lot
    of records in that winter were made by British tourists, many of them coming from Wales.
    Most of them mentioned some Inghams meeting them here and helping them to rent skiing equipment
    and the like.  I assumed that was just some Wales family which owned some cabins
    here and rented one of them out to their fellow countrymen.  Apparently Inghams actually
    refers to a fairly big British
    <a target="_blank"
href="https://www.inghams.co.uk/ski-holidays/ski-resorts/laplandfinland/yllas/yllas-log-cabins">tour operator</a>, specializing
in skiing holidays.  Records from 2013-2015 became much rarer; they didn't mention Inghams 
anymore, and were mostly made by Finns and Germans.  There were no records by Russians.
Nearly all the records were very enthusiastic, talking about skiing and dog and reindeer sled
riding and the other traditional winter stuff.  The temperatures mentioned ranged from -36&deg;C to
-7&deg;C.  Records from summer/autumn months were nearly non-existent.</p>

<p>The windows and the door led onto a small back porch, which looked out directly onto a large patch
    of a harsh-looking spruce forest.</p>
    
<p>As you can see, I already started trying to get online using that Sonera SIM card I bought
    in Kolari.  For some reason, it worked okay in the phone itself (I had a dual-SIM model and
    I kept my main Russian SIM card for emergency calls), but every time I put the phone in Wi-Fi
    router mode and tried to use it from my laptop, it pretty much stopped working completely.
    I tried for half an hour or so and couldn't even check email.  I have no idea how is this
    possible; I had never had any issues using my phone in router mode before.  In the end I gave
    up, but maybe it actually was for the best.  When left alone with my laptop, I tend to waste
    inordinate amounts of time reading Reddit and various blogs and the like.  This way, I had
    Internet on my phone for communication or in case I need to look something up, but mostly
    I had to find something else to occupy myself.</p> 

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/732/21975545121_c1b1d143dd_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/732/21975545121_79e26d699d_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="4" title="TV corner" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>4. There was a TV and I spent most of my evenings with a TV turned on just to have some 
    background noise.  TV shows in Finnish were not particularly useful, but I caught a few
    movies in English from time to time.  Like most European countries (and unlike Russia),
    Finland usually doesn't dub foreign moves, just slapping some Finnish subtitles on them
    instead.  </p>
    
<p>Curiously, there was also an actual, working VHS player under the TV.  Can you imagine
    findind one of these in 2015?  Well, I assume it was working; you'd think that there would
    be some video tapes to watch, but I failed to find any.</p>
    
<p>The brand of the TV by the way was Finlux, and most of kitchen equipment was made by Helkama.
    Both of these are Finnish brands, although Finlux seems to have been bought by the Turks,
    and the consumer applicances division of Helkama closed its original Finnish factory in 2008.
    I'm kind of offended by the common claim that the actual manufacturing of literally everything
    has moved to China and Southeastern Asia, and Europe doesn't actually do anything important
    now.  As far as I understand, everyday stuff like consumer applicances has really largely
    moved to Asia, but Europe's still unsurpassed when it comes to more expensive and specialized
    stuff, like construction equipment or machine tools.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5836/21975549511_2afbd457c8_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5836/21975549511_c660dcaabd_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="5" title="Mansard floor" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>5. Stairs to the mansard floor.  The mansard floor is only half as large as the living room,
    and overlooks it.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/609/21965788015_b98fe9683d_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/609/21965788015_a5ed4e60fe_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="6" title="Mansard bedroom" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>6. There are two beds and a bedstand and not much else there.  </p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/752/21344681673_7e37cd65f8_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/752/21344681673_97f828aa1a_c.jpg" width="532" height="800" alt="7" title="Bathroom" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>7. The bathroom had a sink with a mirror, a shower stall, a toilet, and a washing machine.
    It also had a small window looking out on the parking lot, not even frosted glass or 
    anything, which I found a bit odd.  Everything worked fine, and in particular there weren't any
    problems with hot water.
</p>

<p>There also was a thermostat control by the bathroom door.  It was set a bit too cold when
    I arrived, but I turned it up, and since then the cabin felt as warm as my own apartment.
    I wondered if the heaters can keep it that warm when it is -36&deg;C outside.  Well, there's
    always the fireplace.</p> 

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5784/21953676702_a82cfbd0c1_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5784/21953676702_d38dd549f7_c.jpg" width="532" height="800" alt="8" title="Sauna" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>8. And of course it wouldn't be a Finnish cabin if it didn't have a sauna.  It was a pretty
    usual electric sauna, I was familiar with that type.  It looks like a box with stones, which
    are heated with electricity, and then you pour water on them. </p>


<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5671/21939625446_e28303834d_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5671/21939625446_ab4caef854_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="9" title="After a day of driving" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>9. At this, I finished with exploring the cabin, having been completely satisfied. I still
    felt pretty miserable after sixteen hours of driving.  I made myself some tea, ate a few
    sandwiches, went to sauna for a couple of minutes, and finished off my sparkling wine in bed.  
    I was afraid it would feel creepy to sleep alone in such a cabin, but it really wasn't, despite
    the dark and the odd irregular hum of the fridge, which brought into mind ambience sounds from
    Silent Hill games.   
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/703/21975595481_8d113b720a_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/703/21975595481_811aeec90c_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="10" title="Morning view" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>10. I slept well, for some ten hours or so, and then spent two hours working with photos
    I took the previous day, and composing a letter to my parents.  I like to write them horribly
    detailed letters about my trips.  They love it too, and for me it is a good way to write down
    some details before I forget them.  In fact I'm using these letters very extensively now as
    I write this series.</p>
    
<p>And this was the view which greeted me out of the back porch window, of course.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/718/21778920939_6a376f2aaf_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/718/21778920939_a615817a01_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="11" title="Back porch view" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>11. It was an actual Lapland forest.  It looks very different from the forests of the south
    of Finland or near St. Petersburg, consisting mostly of tall and very narrow spruce trees.
    There are many oddly twisted trees, and the ground and the trunks are extensively covered
    with moss.  The grass cover is short but thick, largely consisting of blueberries.
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5815/21965838145_b1c61ba5e2_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5815/21965838145_39fc8bcafb_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="12" title="Back porch" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>12. The back porch itself.  The guest book mentioned that there often were bird, squirrel, 
    hare, and occasinally reindeer tracks in the snow near the porch in mornings.     </p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5725/21344720423_cf508b1501_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5725/21344720423_0136ce1544_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="13" title="The cabin" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>13. By the time I finally walked out of the cozy cabin it was afternoon.  I decided I would
    explore Äkäslompolo a bit, walking to Jounin Kauppas mall, and then try to find some short
    hiking trail which goes to the fells.  I left my car at the cabin for this day. 
</p>

<p>As you can see, the outer sections of the row house apparently have greater floor area but
    no mansards.  I decided that my apartment was the best one.  The parking lot had engine
    block heater outlets.  These are very common throughout entire Finland (and usually are a
    sure sign of a private parking spot).  Of course there is no need for them in autumn,
    and I don't have a block heater anyway; thankfully St. Petersburg climate is not 
    particularly harsh.</p>   

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/680/21777992468_0fb310b746_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/680/21777992468_defd66c7f1_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="14" title="Niestatie" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>14. My street, named Niestatie.  You can see other log cabins here.  Most of them 
    are probably privately owned, and are not for rent.  There were only two or three cars
    visible, other than mine; the place seemed pretty deserted in that season.
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5671/21344738853_93144f3716_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5671/21344738853_b63dba5520_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="15" title="Tuntirintie" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>15. And this is the main street of Äkäslompolo, named Tunturintie.  The word <i>tunturi</i>
means "fell", the fell being a relatively small mountain with bare flat top.  The word 
<i>tundra</i> has in fact evolved from <i>tunturi</i>, although Äkäslompolo fells have tundra-like
zones only at high elevations.</p>

<p>Tuntirientie road goes to the skiing center at the Ylläs Fell.  Äkäslompolo is surronded
    by seven fells, named Ylläs, Lainio, Kesänki, Kellostapuli, Pyhätunturi, Kukas, and Kuer.
    Any one of the fells can be hiked in a single day by an unprepared moderately healthy person.
    Ylläs is the highest one of these feels, at 719 meters (Äkäslompolo base elevation is
    about 200 m), and the only one actually used for downhill
    skiing.  On the other side of Ylläs there is another ski resort village, named Ylläsjärvi
    <i>(Finn. Ylläs Lake)</i>, which is probably very similar to Äkäslompolo.</p>
    
<p>Ylläs Fell gives its name to Pallas-Yllästunturi National Park, which begins just to the east of
    Äkäslompolo.  Pallas refers to another fell area, about 50 km to the north.  There used 
    to be two separate national parks, Pallas-Ounas and Ylläs-Aakenus, but they were merged into
    one in 2005.  Palls-Yllästunturi is the third largest national park in Finland, with about
    350 km of marked long distance hiking trails.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/638/21778014528_b873f20058_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/638/21778014528_4e1d4afd39_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="16" title="Closed bar" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>16. There are quite a few bars and shops on Tunturintie, but many of them are closed 
    off-season, like this one, "Ylläs Water Well Room".  This constrasts with the rest of Finland,
    where many minor rural museums, restauraunts, and the like work only in summer.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5669/21939703146_f373cd0f68_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5669/21939703146_1fc95ae5d7_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="17" title="Skip equipment shop" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>17. Ski equipment shop.  <i>Jopa</i> <i>(Finn. as low as)</i> means "ass" in Russia, although
it's pronounced differently.  Border cities like Lappeenranta seem to avoid signs like "Jopa 60%" 
for that reason, but of course here in the middle of Lapland nobody cares. </p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5719/21343149084_100b2d7bdf_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5719/21343149084_82e4eca4dc_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="18" title="Tunturintie and Kuer Fell" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>18. The fell to the west of Äkäslompolo visible behind the Tunturintie is Kuer, the lowest
    one of Ylläs Range (446 m).
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/769/21777803040_6dae18c143_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/769/21777803040_85278a32d0_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="19" title="Jounin Kauppas" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>19. Jounin Kauppas <i>(Finn. Jouni's Shop?)</i> mall serves as the natural center of gravity of
    Äkäslompolo.  It consists of two buildings, one of them housing K-Market supermarket and Alko
    liquor store, and the other having some souvenir, sport equipment, and clothing stores.  Both
    buildings also have a restaurant or bar or two.  I was relieved to learn than I could just
    sit down on a couch in the lobby of the second building (pictured) and catch free Wi-Fi from one of the
    bars; at the very least I still needed to send some work-related emails from my laptop. </p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5788/21953764672_750b5740b8_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5788/21953764672_13b0bc473b_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="20" title="Jounin Kauppas" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>20. The local K-Market is pretty massive.  There are K-Markets in nearly every Finnish town,
    but I read claims that this Äkäslompolo one is actually the largest.  That's pretty impressive
    for a village with permanent population of about 400, even for a touristy one.  I had no need
    for grocery shopping yet though.  There is also an automated gas station at the Jounin Kauppas
    parking lot.  </p>

<p>By the way, Äkäslompolo was not built only because of skiing slopes, if you wonder.
    It's a proper old Lapland village, established in 1748, although it isn't far enough north
    to be a Sami settlement.  Skiing only came in 20th century.</p> 

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/761/21343211734_fd2b89bebd_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/761/21343211734_a9b14aa50e_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="21" title="Reindeer antlers" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>21. The first reindeer trace I saw in Lapland were these antlers for sale in a souvenir shop.
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5794/21343219884_e3b60352f2_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5794/21343219884_5aa8d81f88_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="22" title="Restaurant menu" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>22. I ended up never eating out on that trip at all, but here is the menu of one of the 
    restaurants if you're curious.  Reindeer meat is obviously very popular.
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/782/21965918185_657725f83c_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/782/21965918185_915ced5a05_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="23" title="Sauna at Äkäslompolo Lake" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>23. From Jounin Kauppas you can easily walk to Äkäslompolo Lake, which is where the village
    gets its name from.  Äkäslompolo actually means <i>Äkäs Stream Pool</i>, Äkäs (Äkäsjoki)
    being a mid-sized river draining into Torne.  The word <i>lompolo</i> is commonly used for
    stream pools in Lapland; the usual word in Finnish toponymics is <i>suvanto</i>.    
</p>

<p>The building on the shore is probably a sauna, although I'm not sure.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/628/21779034249_8e652ebb54_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/628/21779034249_b0ba948627_c.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="24" title="Äkäslompolo Lake" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>24. The surroundings fells are prominently visible from Äkäslompolo Lake.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/712/21777832680_6660d2b5f2_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/712/21777832680_d4a3c92198_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="25" title="Kesänki Fell" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>25. After Ylläs (which I'll get to in a moment), the highest-looking one is Kesänki.
    That was the fell I decided to climb the next day, all the way to that stony top and back.
</p>

<p>26. A small camping site somewhere at Road 940, the other main street of Äkäslompolo.</p>

<p>27. And here in the distance is Ylläs Fell itself, instantly recognizable due to skiing slopes
    and a tower at the top.

<p>28. This looks more like a traditional hotel than a cabin block, but apparently there are
    very few guests here either.  I generally try to take pictures with as few people as possible,
    but even so, you may have noticed that apart from Jounin Kauppas there seems to be pretty
    much nobody here.  The whole town is just waiting for the skiing season.  Nonetheless,
    I saw a few other people hiking, picknicking, and cross-country cycling in the fells,
    and Jounin Kauppas had actually quite a few people for an off season in such a small town.
    I noticed that the license plates of all the cars I saw here were exclusively Finnish,
    the sole exception being a Swedish car parked at some private house.  So the place gets only
    the locals and rare domestic tourists in autumn.

<p>29. Walking back towards my cabin, I started to look for some hiking trail to move over
    to.  The immediately obvious destination to explore was Ylläs Fell or at least its vicinity.
    I could walk there on a sidewalk by the side of Tunturintie road, but that seemed boring.
    Unfortunately I didn't have a trail map by that point; I had looked for one in my cabin and in
    free tourist brochures in Jounin Kauppas, but there wasn't one.  
    Eventually I spotted a hiking trail, going in an underpass under Tunturintie, and started
    walking on it at random.  Soon I saw some direction signs, which helped me to pick the 
    correct trail.

<p>30. The first non-human Äkäslompolo inhabinant I encountered.</p>

<p>31. There were lots of berries even right by the Tuntirintie shoulder.  I hoped to find
    some cloudberries which Lapland is famous for, but I never found any.  I think they
    ripen much earlier in the summer.  There were various odd mushrooms too, like these ones
    resembling turtle shells.
</p>

<p>32. It seems even the smallest gravel roads here in Lapland have these bright orange
    poles, which help to keep road visible even when it is completely swept over with snow.
    Occasionally they can be seen in southern regions, too, but they're nowhere that common
    there.</p>
    
<p>Having found the correct trail, I walked to the Ylläs skiing center, and then onto
    Varkaankuru nature trail.  To be continued.</p>
