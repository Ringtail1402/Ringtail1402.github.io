<p>So, after finding a hiking trail in Äkäslompolo, I soon reached a crossroads with some 
    pointers:</p> 

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5727/21779187259_830eb6d0e7_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5727/21779187259_6485b29493_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="1" title="Äkäslompolo trail" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>1. <i>Äkäshotelli</i>, presumably a hotel, seems to be the place in Äkäslompolo 
where most local trails start.  Other destinations I had some idea about were Tunturi-Ylläs
(Ylläs Fell, presumably), Kellokas (nature center whether some other trails start), and Ylläsjärvi
(village on the other side of Ylläs Fell).  I decided I wanted to see Ylläs and walked
to the left.  </p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5658/21343333454_dceff60060_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5658/21343333454_b213be072a_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="2" title="Trail in an underpass" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>2. This trail goes through a few underpasses under Tunturintie and other roads.  Safety first. </p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/737/21344953853_d2a3a6e87a_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/737/21344953853_321828ac28_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="3" title="Wet trail" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>3. One of the stretches close to Äkäslompolo passes through some wet though walkable
    terrain.  It looks like this trail is more commonly used as a skiing track in winter.
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/602/21953969142_dba8df1f62_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/602/21953969142_a5e48ea623_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="4" title="Bikers" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>4. After the wet stretch ended, I saw two women in their thirties on bikes ahead.
    As the trail started to go uphill, they went slowly and stopped often and I passed
    them several times.  By the third time I felt somewhat awkward and ended up waiting a bit
     behind a bend myself so that they may ride ahead.

<p>5. The trail itself entered the forest and became wide and dry, apparently covered with 
    sawdust.
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5659/21975971841_9bc27936bf_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5659/21975971841_1e9830b61d_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="6" title="Forest carpet" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>6. I loved the carpet of vegetation in this forest, low and thick and touched with yellow
    and red already.  Here and there heaps of greenish blue (actually greyish blue and covered
    with large patches of light green lichen) stones peeked through grass.  I'm used to big
    granite boulders in Karelian forests, but these are very different, being much smaller and
     brighter.</p>
     
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/724/21940034036_8a5c9dd201_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/724/21940034036_a114881218_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="7" title="Skiing road signs" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>7. There are even some road signs for skiers, just like real ones, but several times smaller.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/679/21778145810_2c3eca8531_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/679/21778145810_738350985a_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="8" title="Blueberries" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>8. The vegetation is basically blueberries and moss.  Too bad I'm not a great fan of berries.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/725/21954144712_05fa9192c9_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/725/21954144712_1fc8d84fd2_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="9" title="Ylläs skiing slopes" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>9. I emerged out of this forest by the Tunturintie again, very close to Ylläs skiing slopes.
    The skiing center is pretty huge, but of course it looks almost completely deserted in
    snowless season.  It's even sort of sad.
</p>

<p><a name="10" href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/610/21345169003_6db1be8367_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/610/21345169003_bcce958140_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="10" title="Ylläs map" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>10. A nice big map on an information board.  It shows Äkäslompolo, all the surrounding
    fells (as brownish patches), and all the hiking trails (thick orange and other lines).
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5762/21966431025_6ce1fae6fe_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5762/21966431025_7d34db9ee1_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="11" title="Reindeer" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>11. Walking idly on the skiing center parking lot, I saw a reindeer all of a sudden!
    I was able to get close to this guy easily.</p>
    
<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5735/21778650658_ee0024a018_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5735/21778650658_47588e1b75_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="12" title="Reindeer" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>12. Reindeer are of course traditionally associated with Lapland and the North in general,
    and rightly so.  Unless you spend your entire vacation in a hotel, you're extremely likely to see
    some herd or two near any Lapland village.  All reindeer in Lapland are domestic animals,
    and are owned and herded by someone.  Although I'm not sure how this works; I never saw
    any person near them.  In the Nordic countries wild reindeer only remain in the isolated
    mountains of Southern Norway. </p> 
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5747/21966557905_13e4b1e26a_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5747/21966557905_584ee19ce6_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="13" title="Reindeer herd" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>13. Reindeer were traditionally herded by the Sami for their meat, fur, milk, antlers, and as    
    pack animals.
    Come to think of it, there's not much else to eat in the North.  Well there is fish in lakes,
    and also berries, but that's about it.  In Sweden and Norway only Sami are still allowed to keep
    reindeer; there is no such limitation in Finland.  Of course nowadays Lapland is quite
    civilized, with roads, electricity, supermarkets, and modern housing, and probably no one
    really <i>needs</i> to keep reindeer to survive.  Still, this remains a traditional
    occupation for the Sami.  Reindeer are also very popular with tourists.  If you go to Lapland
    in winter, trying reindeer sledding is probably a must.    
</p>

<p>It's kind of a philosophical question whether it is worth it to continue doing reindeer
    herding even if it does not really make economic sense anymore.  The state provides subsidies
    to herders, although these are not awfully great, just 15% of their expenses or so.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5780/21954423442_a7e7136fc0_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5780/21954423442_6fc892b26a_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="14" title="Reindeer herd" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>14. Anyway, reindeer are very beautiful animals.  They aren't very large, the largest
    being the size of a pony, and many are more like a very big dog.  Unlike regular
    deer and moose, female reindeer sport antlers too.  They shed them once a year, and
    those with smaller antlers may have them still covered by skin.  At least this herd
    of about twenty
    looks to be in excellent health.  They are all very clean and do not smell at all.</p>
     
<p>I read about reindeer before embarking on my trip -- first of all, I checked whether
    they have been known to attack humans in any cases.  Apparently this is pretty
    much unheard of.  They are very docile and really, for all their beauty and grace, they
    behave pretty much exactly like cows.  Instead of mooing they make funny snorting
    sounds, but otherwise they wander around, munch on grass, and ignore almost everything
    around them in exactly the same way.  There's a lot of stuff they will eat,
    including grass, leaves, berries, and mushrooms, but their favorite snack is
    reindeer lichen.  It doesn't look very tasty but reindeer digestive system
    is adapted to extract a lot of of nutrients from it, and there's a <i>lot</i> of this lichen
    around in Lapland.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/625/21343833774_5b05bdb6de_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/625/21343833774_b34d54bdcc_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="15" title="Varkaankuru trail" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>15. After admiring the reindeer herd, I walked on a trail marked as <i>Varkaankuru</i>.
  Varkaankuru is one of the shortest and most accessible
    nature trails around Äkäslompolo.  I remembered this name from some website
    about Lapland.</p>
    
<p>In general, trails in Finland and likely other Nordic countries are divided into nature
    trails and hiking trails.  Nature trails are meant for coming with all your family and
    exploring in an afternoon and maybe even having a picnic. They can be from  0.5 to about 8 km 
    long.  They are usually named and very clearly marked, easy to walk with no wet stretches or
    anything, and
    often have some information boards along the way.  So in other words they are intended for
    more casual audience, being easy enough to accomodate even children, dogs, and sometimes 
    even disabled people.</p>
    
    <p>
      Hiking trails, on the other hand, may be tens or even hundreds
    of kilometers long.  They are often less thoroughly marked, and may have
    difficult terrain or obstacles such as minor rivers.  They are meant for more serious
    tourists, with backpacks and tents.  (I would also add a "connecting" trail type to these
    two; that would be relatively short trails which simply connect some destinations
    without claiming to be particularly special in any way.  The trail I walked from
    Äkäslompolo to Ylläs would qualify as one.)  Varkaankuru thus is a typical nature trail,
    at 4 km.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/582/21976349171_13c9f419f4_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/582/21976349171_b940d8ee14_c.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="16" title="Varkaanoja waterfall" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>16. Soon enough I heard sound of rushing water.  Varkaankuru means 
    <i>Thief's Ravine</i> (I wonder what's the story behind this name) 
    but it's really not much of a ravine; it is actually a tiny
    valley of a tiny Varkaanoja brook, which flows where slopes of Ylläs and adjoining
    Kelostapuli fells meet.  The valley is covered with unusually lush forest.  My 
    understanding is that Varkaankuru landscape isn't really typical of Lapland,
    but it's certainly a very pretty trail.</p>
    
<p>Coming from the skiing center (you're actually supposed to walk Varkaankuru in the
    opposite direction, starting at Kellokas nature center), the trail reaches
    Varkaankuru at a small pond named Varkaanlampi.  There you cross the brook and
    then walk downstream, mostly on plankways (which get quite slippery
    in wet weather).  The plankways cross the brook several times, changing
    between banks.</p>

<p>Varkaankuru trail felt a little bit crowded, as far as trails in Lapland go.
    I met several large families, with children and dogs, and some old and young
    couples too.  Of course you still won't find any trace of people in my pictures.</p>

<p><a name="21" href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/618/21345492803_3076871dbf_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/618/21345492803_fff1bdf3a9_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="21" title="Varkaankuru laavu" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>21. There are two rather large <i>laavu</i> shelters along the brook.  <i>Laavu</i> is
a Finnish name for a lean-to shelter, which consists of three walls, a roof, and a fireplace
in front of it (often there is also an outhouse, a wood stack, etc.)  They are usually found
along nature and hiking trails, but some laavus may be located in very remote and hard to
reach locations.  These days laavus are most useful for hikers, although the tradition
of building them comes from hunting and fishing.</p>

<p>Easily accessible laavus at nature trails are usually used for family picnics, and in fact 
    this laavu was occupied by some family.  Used as shelter, laavus make it possible to stay 
    overnight
    with just a sleeping bag; no tent required.  Still, there are some etiquette rules
    about using laavus; in particular, if a laavu is full but more people wishing to use it
    arrive, then they will have priority and laavu should be freed up for them, regardless
    of time of the day or weather.  Most people just put up a tent near a laavu, rather
    than sleeping directly in it.  Staying at a laavu for more than two nights is also
    discouraged.</p>
    
     <p>There are thousands of laavus across
entire Finland; a list of known laavus is maintained at <a target="_blank"
 href="http://laavu.org/">laavu.org</a> website (Finnish only; pick a region from <i>Selaa</i>
 menu to see them on a map).</p>

<p>There are a few other types of shelter, although all of them are much less common than
    laavus:</p>
    
<ul>
    <li><i>kota</i> (from Sami <i>goahti</i>, also known as <i>lavvu</i>) is pretty much a teepee,
    a conical structure with a fireplace in the middle.  Cozy but doesn't really work for sleeping.
    The list at <i>laavu.org</i> also includes kotas.</li>
    <li><i>autiotupa</i> is a wilderness hut, a very basic but complete house, with a stove
    and beds.   Autiotupas do not have a lock, and are still usable by anyone.  
    There is a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.laavu.org/autiotuvat/">separate list</a> of them
    at <i>laavu.org</i>.  You can notice that unlike laavus which are ubiquitous in Finland
    autiotupas are only really common in the North.  Same sharing rules apply as with laavus.</li>
    <li><i>varaustupa</i> is a reservation hut, which requires obtaining a key beforehand.
    The key should be available at nature centers (like the Kellokas at Ylläs).  I'm not
    really familiar for the rules for this type of hut.</li>
</ul>

<p>In national parks at least laavus and huts are maintained by Metsähallitus, Finnish
    Forestry Department.  To be precise, it maintains all the national parks entirely.
    I guess they must employ a <i>lot</i> of people to be able to care about those
    national parks so well.  Thus I like to imagine that Metsähallitus is secretly the
    most important and powerful organization in Finland, which really runs the entire
    country, sort of like Freemasons or Illuminati.</p>
    
<p>Official Finnish <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nationalparks.fi/">national parks and
     hiking website</a> (which by the way is great)
    offers <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nationalparks.fi/en/huts/typesofhuts">a more
    complete guide</a> on various types of shelters.</p>    

<p>Sweden and Norway have similar systems of hiking shelters but I do not know much about them.
    I believe Sweden in particular has some gorgeous manned cabins (just imagine such a job,
    maintaining a cabin in the middle of nowhere among the mountains!), and most shelters
    in Norway are reservation huts.</p>

<p>22. Varkaankuru plankway.</p>

<p>23. I'm not that much of a photographer, but taking good pictures of woods is difficult.
    It's all too easy to end up with something that looks like a mess of green and brown.
    Even lighting which is normally what makes a landscape photo good may not help. </p>

<p>28. More of those greenish blue rocks, scattered in the moss.  I often regret that
    I know nothing about geology or botany; then maybe I could have told you more than you already
    see for yourself.  How do you
    go around learning this stuff at an amateur level, anyway?  Are there some good books?
</p>

<p>29. Information boards help a bit.  All too often they're only in Finnish though, including
    most of the boards on this trail.  I have a beginner Finnish textbook and in fact I got
    through its first few chapters, but the part with seventeen noun cases or so just stops
    me cold in my tracks. </p>

<p>30. Well anyway here's some of that juniper the previous board talked about.  
    I realized I probably never ever saw juniper before.

<p>31. </p>

<p>33. 
    
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/736/21778970818_5a8b822815_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/736/21778970818_f4432f0017_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="34" title="Trail to Kellokas" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>34. Eventually I reached a fork.  One of the trails left the brook and went to Kellokas
    nature center, and the other one continued along, promising to reach Äkäslompolo.  I intended
    to go back to Äkäslompolo, but decided to make a detour to Kellokas.  Maybe there's
    something worthwhile there.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/657/21966844165_6c92d15c35_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/657/21966844165_5ba3f65e4c_c.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="35" title="Telescope" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>35. Some stairs led up from Varkaankuru ravine.  An information table invited to look into
    this telescope (actually just an empty metal tube without any lenses -- I don't know whether
    it's supposed to be this way) and guess how far away is the top of Kellostapuli Fell,
    visible right ahead.  The answer is less than 1 km, some 700 meters or so.  It's a fairly
    steep fell. </p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/707/21976627581_1589b93072_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/707/21976627581_6b185eb446_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="36" title="Trail to Kellokas" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>36. After climbing out of the ravine, trail goes through this wetland patch.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/775/21779958609_a0b4733294_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/775/21779958609_1fd7f350ff_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="37" title="Kellokas statues" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>37. Some downright odd statues greet you at Kellokas, like this woman flipping the bird.
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/595/21940689316_f9f9e94651_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/595/21940689316_07c51a33b5_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="38" title="Kellokas statues" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>38. Or this old man hare. </p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/721/21779970579_3086ce9780_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/721/21779970579_b1f8bc5d3d_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="39" title="Kellokas nature center" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>39. The nature center itself was closed, as I suspected.  It closes at 5 PM, and it was
    something closer to 6 PM at the moment.  Well at least I knew where it was located --
    right by Tunturintie between Äkäslompolo and Ylläs skiing center.
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5772/21344144984_cce6ef8c88_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5772/21344144984_9d58bf79be_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="40" title="National park sign" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>40. Backtracking on the same trail.  This standard sign denotes the border of a national
    park or another protected area.  Varkaankuru trail is located entirely within
    Pallas-Yllästunturi National Park limits, although Kellokas and Ylläs skiing center
    formally aren't.
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/686/21344174554_a89a5a99fb_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/686/21344174554_68316b4485_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="41" title="From Varkaankuru to Äkäslompolo" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>41. The trail from Varkaankuru to Äkäslompolo continues along Varkaanoja brook for a
    little more.
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5806/21345782453_b146b0a48e_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5806/21345782453_20525b45aa_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="42" title="From Varkaankuru to Äkäslompolo" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>42. Then there is another fork, and Äkäslompolo trail turns off into a forest,
    leaving Varkaanoja to flow into Kesänkijoki river
    in a few hundred meters downstream. </p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/721/21778822930_335cbb4375_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/721/21778822930_bd3f7ac7b6_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="43" title="Äkäslompolo outskirts" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>43. Direction signs at forks and orange-topped poles along trails make it very
    difficult to get lost, but I still did, ending up on this odd water-eroded road
    leading nowhere.  The trail apparently runs along it for a little while, then
    continues into the forest on the other side of the road, but I didn't realize
    that at the time.  
    Still, I was close enough to Äkäslompolo that I could just turn on my GPS
    navigator (which isn't very useful for hiking, as it doesn't know about any trails
    or terrain, but still can show your position) and find a dirt road which
    soon got some cabins along it.
    I ended up walking the last kilometer to my cabin right through the forest
    between these cabins. </p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/747/21345798693_7c031975d4_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/747/21345798693_7e2ed3777b_c.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="44" title="Fireplace" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>44. I forgot to take any food along, so I was very hungry by the time I got home,
    and made myself some instant noodles first of all.
    My cabin was as cozy as ever, but this time I decided to try to make
    it even cozier by making a fire.  There was a basket of firewood, some old
    papers, and a matchbox.  I never had any experience making a fire, but it turned
    out to be easy enough.  I made sure to open the flue at the mansard, as a warning
    sign said; then I put some papers and small pieces of firewood into the fireplace
    and struck a match.  After the fire began to grow, I started adding larger logs.
    Eventually I made a mistake somewhere and the fire went out, but I lit it again
    and from there it all was quite smooth.  
</p>

<p>I opened a beer and, ignoring <i>Night at the Museum</i> on TV, sat down to watch <i>Citizen
     Kane</i>, hoping to acquire myself with
the classics of cinema (I brought some movies and TV shows on my laptop).  It turned out
that the basket of firewood I had was enough
for just an hour and a half.  It was a bit disappointing; I thought it would last
for an evening. Anyway, I didn't intend
to buy more firewood and light the fireplace again; it was too much bother, and
being alone, I didn't really need to create any romantic mood or something.</p>

<p>For the next day, I intended to climb one of the surrounding fells -- I didn't
    really come close to doing that yet.  To be continued.</p>
