<p>On my second day in Fell Lapland, I decided to try something a bit more exciting
    than exploring the village and the easiest trails.  I wanted to climb one of the fells,
    and spend a lot of time in the morning deliberating on the choice of that fell.
    With this and working on photos and letters, I set out only at 2 PM, having failed to
    really decide
    on anything.  I drove to Kellokas nature center, intending to buy a map and start my walk 
    there.  The distance from my cabin to Kellokas was only
    about two kilometers, but I decided to drive rather than walk anyway, to conserve
    energy for later.</p>
    
<p>I was taken aback by how many cars there were at Kellokas parking lot.  It felt a lot 
    more crowded than, say, Jounin Kauppas supermarket parking lot.
    It looked like I wasn't the only one who wanted
    to go hiking.  Nonetheless I only met a few people during that day.</p>
    
<p>I can't really explain what is the exact purpose of Kellokas nature center, as I don't
    really know myself.  It has a map and souvenir shop, a cafeteria, a library, probably other
    things.  I quickly found the map I wanted, which was the <a href="/en/2016/01/31/lappi3/#10"
    target="_blank">same one</a> I saw on an information board at Ylläs skiing slopes the previous
    day, only pocket-sized.  &euro;6 felt like rather a lot for such a small map. 
    It was really extremely useful though, and I guess the national park must make at least
    a bit of money somehow.  It's not like they can charge simply for entering;
    that would be a violation of the ancient Everyman's Right.</p>
    
<p>I looked through the rest of the shop's inventory, but didn't find anything particularly
    notable.  There were lots of other maps, including some of rather remote areas like
    Kilpisjärvi or Utsjoki.  The souvenirs were more or less what you would expect, including
    cloudberry sauce and jam.  I was more interested in cloudberry liqueur, but as with 
    any hard alcohol in Finland, that could only be found in a specialized Alko store.</p>
    
<p>After examining the map, I decided I wanted to walk a trail named Tähtipolku <i>(Finn.
    Star Trail)</i>, which climbed Kesänki Fell (it's <i>KEH-san-kee</i> by the way) through
    Pirunkuru Ravine.  At this, I set out from Kellokas.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/624/21779072028_31c025c694_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/624/21779072028_53f04e6455_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="1" title="Walking to Varkaankuru" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>1. Officially, Tähtipolku trail doesn't really start at Kellokas, so I had to walk
    parts of Varkaankuru and Hillapolku <i>(Finn. Cloudberry Trail)</i> first.  So this
    is me walking to Varkaankuru again.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5630/21779075678_85c3f8bd3d_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5630/21779075678_7e923d803e_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="2" title="Juniper" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>2. Some more juniper.  Its berries are actually tiny cones.  Crazy, right?</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/590/21780056139_c6888bc9c9_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/590/21780056139_dabececb35_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="3" title="Varkaanoja Brook" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>3. Walking by Varkaanoja Brook again.  The foam on its rapids is snow white.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5656/21345841893_dd399b3686_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5656/21345841893_560c74e6b6_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="4" title="Varkaanoja Brook" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>4. </p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/638/21779123148_e5bdf04c91_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/638/21779123148_d686446728_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="5" title="Hillapolku" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>5. From Varkaankuru I turned onto Hillapolku trail, which goes in circle around Kesänkijärvi
    Lake. </p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/740/21954846802_55a90c70c6_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/740/21954846802_3c8eed92da_c.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="6" title="Kesänki and Kesänkijärvi" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>6. Here is that lake, peeking through the trees.  And the fell behind the lake is
    Kesänki itself.
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/752/21967022955_6bd338056f_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/752/21967022955_2585c9cf7d_c.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="7" title="Kesänkijärvi Lake" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>7. Kesänkijärvi shores are mostly waterlogged.  I walked to the shore on some tiny trail
    which soon disappeared in a marsh.  I got some water in my boots but still managed to get
    to the edge of the water.   </p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5677/21778941550_6aa39d853d_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5677/21778941550_cc4df52e20_c.jpg" width="532" height="800" alt="8" title="Marshes near Kesänkijärvi" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>8. Even more waterlogged area by the main Hillapolku trail.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5663/21344582784_1fc9f8425e_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5663/21344582784_f1bd4343e3_c.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="9" title="Kesänkijoki bridge" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>9. Part of the trail has to continue on a plankway, and a larger bridge crosses Kesänkijoki
    River, which flows in and out of the lake, and then into Äkäslompolo Lake in the namesake
    vilage. </p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/650/21779221920_5c6ae290f7_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/650/21779221920_87579621bd_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="10" title="Kesängin Keidas" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>10. You'd think it would be nearly impossible to build anything in such a wet and roadless place,
    but here is Kesängin Keidas <i>(Finn. Kesänki Oasis)</i>, a cafeteria.  It is meant for skiers,
    and it looked like it was closed in that time of year.  I guess it's only really possible to
    supply such a cafeteria when the marshes freeze over and it becomes reachable with a snowmobile
    or something.
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/638/21967323855_d2dcf934ef_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/638/21967323855_570bfb011c_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="11" title="Hillapolku plankways" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>11. It's also possible to walk to a tiny pier at the lake here, so I guess I could have
    avoided getting water in my boots. </p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/646/21779467868_f031de2942_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/646/21779467868_81bb3e5ec4_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="12" title="Swans in Kesänkijärvi" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>12. Three swans swam out on the lake. </p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/607/21941167506_30b58d6a29_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/607/21941167506_ff6a79055d_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="13" title="Tähtipolku" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>13. After the cafeteria, Hillapolku trail continues along the lake shore, and Tähtipolku
    starts here and begins to climb the Kesänki Fell.  I'm not sure why they chose to name it
    "Star Trail", but there were small astronomy-themed information boards along this trail.
    They were translated into English, but there wasn't anything interesting in them;
    all the information was on a children book level.  
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/720/21779249380_224fcd4e82_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/720/21779249380_7cce538e3f_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="14" title="Crossroads" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>14. </p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/764/21346218793_603c980cdd_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/764/21346218793_2ef9b91e1f_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="15" title="Tähtipolku markers" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>15. The part of the climb through the forest was easy enough.  Like the other trails, 
    Tähtipolku is marked with orange-topped poles.  For named trails these poles also have the
    corresponding sign on them, which in this case was, appropriately, a blue star.
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5741/21955214502_208bee947e_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5741/21955214502_857dca6a58_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="16" title="Revontuli" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>16. This is the part which explains why northern lights are called <i>revontuli</i> <i>(fox
    fire)</i> in Finnish.  I guess watching northern lights from the top of the fell must
    be pretty spectacular.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/711/21977141711_32601100af_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/711/21977141711_2ca02ed4ba_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="17" title="Pirunkuru" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>17. This part of the climb is appropriately named Pirunkuru, Devil's Ravine.  It is steep
    and fairly challenging, requiring you to walk uphill on these jagged stones, while trying
    not to break your leg.  
</p>

<p>The summits of most of the fells at Ylläs are completely covered with similar stones, and
    I guess this stone run at Pirunkuru is just a spillover.  Supposedly these stones were
    formed in the Ice Age by multiple cycles of water freezing and thawing in cracks of the exposed
    rock surface.</p> 

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/723/21344645064_f9fb9dfe5e_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/723/21344645064_c9d1643b76_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="18" title="Climbing Pirunkuru" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>18. Kelostapuli Fell begins to show behind my back.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/716/21955235542_dc7caebee0_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/716/21955235542_bb0958888b_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="19" title="Climbing Pirunkuru" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>19. This isn't the first time I saw a similar stone run.  In fact this entire climb
    brought strong memories of Zuratkul Mountain in the South Urals back in 2010.
    I still lived in Yekaterinburg back then and didn't own a car, so it took a train,
    a bus, and a taxi to reach Zuratkul Lake and its nearby mountain chain.  The mountain
    was of a similar height and the climb offered similar views, although the landscape at
    the top was quite different.  Overall Zuratkul was probably the prettiest place in
    Russia I've ever been to.  </p>

<p>The perceived similarity made me think about mining.  Ural Mountains are famous for
    having been mined for all kinds of ores and some gemstones before.  Does Lapland
    have any significant mines?  I know that there was a Lapland gold rush in some part of it,
    not entirely dissimilar to the American one, and of course there were nickel mines in
    Petsamo, immensely important to Hitler; but that part of Finland was re-annexed by the
    Soviet Union after war.  But was there anything else?  I googled a lot after returning
    to St. Petersburg and found out that some major mines are just about to start being 
    constructed in Lapland.  Apparently that's a controversial matter too -- on one hand,
    the mines would bring lots of tax revenue and jobs (unemployment is, unsurprisingly,
    a major problem in Lapland); on the other hand, chances of wrecking many local ecosystems,
    nearly undisturbed since time immemorial, are very high.</p>
    
<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/721/21955240352_33b3c37183_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/721/21955240352_c7918087d7_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="20" title="Treeline" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>20. I'm about to rise above the treeline, although it's not very clearly defined here.
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/688/21346256343_39850e12ac_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/688/21346256343_21d38f9213_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="21" title="Above the treeline" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>21. I had to stop and rest a bit fairly often, but at least I could enjoy the views.
    Kesänkijärvi Lake is now clearly visible below, and Ylläs Fell peeks from behind
    Kelostapuli.  
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5784/21967396565_0a03a15e44_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5784/21967396565_f1b803c2d2_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="22" title="Top of Pirunkuru" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>22. By the time the steep part of the climb finished, sun peeked out from the clouds.
    As you might have noticed, the weather during my Lapland trip was not generally very exciting.
    It wasn't cold but the sky was mostly overcast, with an occasinal drizzle.  That's my
    favorite kind of weather actually, but it doesn't work well for photos.  So I was lucky to
    get some rays of light at an appropriate moment.
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5645/21967399985_2c8b797647_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5645/21967399985_72491d6896_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="23" title="Top of Pirunkuru" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>23. My favorite picture from the entire first half of my vacation (before the big trip farther
    up north).
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/570/21955253412_2f1a9881ef_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/570/21955253412_e96715039b_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="24" title="Top of Pirunkuru" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>24. I met an old Finnish man, also climbing Kesänki, and he said to me "Terve!".  Of course
    the best answer I could manage was "Sorry?" in a silly voice.  "Hello?.." said he uncertainly.
    "Oh, hello!".  Damn.  How could I have forgotten that "Terve" means just "Hello"?  The man
    must now think that I was retarded.   </p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/773/21967408315_9d6ae2916a_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/773/21967408315_a41e59b08a_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="25" title="Top of Pirunkuru" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>25. A woman waited for him on top.  Here they are, sitting on a rock below.  I sat down in
    the distance too and munched on a bag of crisps I brought with me.
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/606/21779546708_af7c898d72_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/606/21779546708_04184712f8_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="26" title="Tähtipolku on top of Kesänki" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>26. Kesänki Fell has at least three summits, and Tähtipolku trail passes between two of them.
    I decided to go off trail a bit and climb one of the summits.  It was in just a few hundred
    meters, and the remaining climb was extremely shallow.
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/670/21779323290_0490474583_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/670/21779323290_8303a64ed4_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="27" title="On top of Kesänki" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>27. Two other summits are visible in the distance.  The highest one is actually the farthest.
    With so many stones, it's only obvious
    someone decided to make a cairn. </p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5682/21967428245_31c26f6040_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5682/21967428245_7f20fd87bd_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="28" title="Distant fells" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>28. These fells far to the north could be Pallas and its neighbors.  Although
    it's more likely these are just the farthest Ylläs-related fells, such as Pyhätunturi.
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5675/21779331820_353e475ffc_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5675/21779331820_5ffbbfe1cd_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="29" title="Kesänki summit" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>29. At the very summit there is a much larger cairn, as high as a man, among smaller ones.
    I wondered who and when started to make this cairn.  I added ten stones into the pile myself,
    and took another one with me.  I like to bring home random stones from various trips, although
    I'm not very consistent about this. 
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/656/21779568398_3758c4ba7b_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/656/21779568398_fc891f4f68_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="30" title="Kesänkijoki and Äkäslompolo" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>30. The view from the southwestern slope of the summit.  Part of Kesänkijärvi Lake is
    visible at the bottom.  The narrow stripe of Kesänkijoki River flows from it across
    the picture into Äkäslompolo Lake to the right.  On the shores of the lake are Äkäslompolo
     village buildings; behind them is shallow Kuer Fell. 
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/631/21346307123_dd3a42a4f8_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/631/21346307123_d0766fb3cf_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="31" title="Ylläs Fell" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>31. Further to the left is Ylläs Fell with its skiing slopes.  Skiing center is visible
    at the bottom of the slopes. </p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5688/21779584118_f0ede8f2b5_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5688/21779584118_554f97a6ea_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="32" title="Kesänki summit" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>32. The elevation of this summit of Kesänki is about 520 m above sea level.  Kesänkijärvi Lake 
    is located at 218 m above sea level.  So it appears I climbed about 300 meters.
</p>

<p>33. The summit is almost devoid of vegetation, but occasional patches of moss and berries
    are still found between rocks, and there are very rare tiny trees. </p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/610/21344728874_10b456785e_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/610/21344728874_4633d7711a_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="34" title="Tähtipolku on top of Kesänki" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>34. Returning from the summit, I located Tähtipolku trail again, and began to descend
    on the other side of the fell. 
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5723/21346337913_11f747bc16_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5723/21346337913_1613cd1d2e_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="35" title="Tahkokuru" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>35. The descent is named Tahkokuru <i>(Finn. Grindstone Ravine?)</i>.  Completely unlike
the Pirunkuru side, it was very shallow and easy to walk and didn't look even remotely like a
ravine.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5709/21346357393_cec798765a_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5709/21346357393_84acdb2cd0_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="36" title="Tahkokuru" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>36. Tundra-like mosses and dwarf trees eventually replace bare stone runs again.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/781/21941312006_786b02061e_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/781/21941312006_230d8de1df_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="37" title="Dwarf birches" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>37. I love these twisted dwarf birches.  They are more sturdy than coniferous trees and
    disappear at a higher elevetion.  You'd think that those needles would be more enduring but no.
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/756/21941324036_bddfa250cf_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/756/21941324036_5fae5cee29_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="38" title="Tahkokuru laavu" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>38. At the exact spot where tundra and regular Lapland forest meet there is a laavu shelter.
   I talked about laavus at length in the <a href="/en/2016/01/31/lappi3/#21"
    target="_blank">previous part</a>.  This laavu was unoccupied so I could have a closer look. 
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/671/21779648518_cb3a34fb8a_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/671/21779648518_dbcd75356a_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="39" title="Tahkokuru laavu log book" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>39. There was a log book inside the laavu.  All or nearly all entries were in Finnish. </p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5805/21977293241_a467dfe682_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5805/21977293241_116a010f09_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="40" title="Tahkokuru laavu fireplace" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>40. Coals in the fireplace still smouldered.  Someone has been here shortly before me.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/730/21941340146_40b5e8050e_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/730/21941340146_6d39303fea_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="41" title="Tahkokuru laavu firewood" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>41. There were several huge bags of firewood strewn about sloppily.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5691/21941343076_5aa7de51c3_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5691/21941343076_772ba49fe5_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="42" title="Outhouse" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>42. And an outhouse.  M is for men, obviously <i>(mies)</i>, and
N is for women <i>(nainen)</i>, not for "neuter".  Most toilets in Finland just use
pictures to avoid confusion.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5740/21780623819_81c29a32fc_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5740/21780623819_f941d4b418_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="43" title="Forest" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>43. Walking on.  This kind of forest became very familiar for me by that time. </p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5755/21344799454_1fc2d54b4e_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5755/21344799454_22b5866797_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="44" title="Reindeer droppings" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>44. I saw a pile of reindeer droppings and of course I couldn't help taking a picture.
    They are less cute than rabbit droppings which I as a happy rabbit owner know everything about.
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/596/21941356976_fddfd7db2c_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/596/21941356976_fa0b4c2785_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="45" title="Aspen bolete" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>45. Beautiful red-capped scaber stalk mushroom, sadly already picked and thrown away by someone.
    (Is this really the proper English name for this mushroom? Sounds so awkward.  Its Russian
    name simply means "one under aspen".) </p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/645/21344807534_8605332d04_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/645/21344807534_c37d6d4c73_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="46" title="Tahtipolku sign" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>46. At this sign, I left Tahtipolku trail again, crossing a small dirt road
    (The trail loops around Kesänki fell, and starts and finishes at a small parking lot.)
    There are so many wooden signs in this style across entire country.  The people
    who make these signs must be the richest men in Finland.
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5757/21344810544_6a2db3ac06_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5757/21344810544_0542c9f6b1_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="47" title="Kesänki and Kesänkijoki River" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>47. I intended to return to Kellokas via another trail.  This one crossed Kesänkijoki River
    downstream from the lake.  The fell in the background is Kesänki itself, which I had just
    ascended and descended.
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5729/21780642729_0af62e5b9b_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5729/21780642729_28192cf81d_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="48" title="Kesänkijoki River" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>48. Kesänkijoki River.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/595/21779459440_25b26cdfc5_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/595/21779459440_d78e451b5b_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="49" title="Hormistonjänkkä Marsh" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>49. Passing by a few houses on the outskirts of Äkäslompolo, the trail
    crosses small Hormistonjänkkä Marsh on plankways.   </p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5720/21955426582_1d137e9ea4_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5720/21955426582_81a84f31ca_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="50" title="Reindeer near Kellokas" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>50. The final stretch of the trail near Kellokas was extremely wet and unpleasant, with
    numerous small streams crossing it, and some huge puddles.  At least by the time I reached
    Kellokas I was rewarded with another meeting with reindeer.  This very likely was the
    same herd I saw the day before.
</p>

<p>Soon I reached my car and drove back to my cabin.  The rest of the day was uneventful.
    I began binge watching <i>Rick and Morty</i> and it was hilarious although I still rate
    <i>Archer</i> better.  I was very tired but I enjoyed that day immensely, having 
    really seen a tiny bit of the beauty of Lapland.  To be continued.</p>
