<p>So here I am at Treriksröset, the border stone of Finland, Sweden, and Norway, and I've got 
    to return to civilization as soon as possible.  Booking.com said Birtavarre Camping
    reception closes at 20:00, and it was about 15:00 at the moment, and walking the trail 
    from the parking lot at Northern Lights Road to Treriksröset in first place took me 3.5 hours.  As exhausted
    as I was, I couldn't afford to waste much time.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/652/21956736332_9f74abe8bb_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/652/21956736332_125973894d_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="1" title="Walk from Treriksröset" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>1. The first section of the way back was the hardest, with a slow long climb back onto
    the plateau through a birch forest.  Each five minutes or so I stopped for a minute to
    catch my breath.
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/599/21780800370_2922a042fc_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/599/21780800370_aa503f4e8b_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="2" title="Walk from Treriksröset" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>2. Back on the plateau walking became much easier.  The weather became a bit clearer and the 
    lighting got nicer in the late afternoon.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5727/21347784393_bc95798f8d_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5727/21347784393_762dd4c28f_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="3" title="Walk from Treriksröset" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>3. </p>

<p>4. Malla mountain is to the left.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/646/21978811731_713511440b_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/646/21978811731_01c8946bcc_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="5" title="Walk from Treriksröset" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>5. Walking on Malla slope.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5641/21347961553_8aebb5d183_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5641/21347961553_d4e072310c_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="6" title="Walk from Treriksröset" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>6. And by the small mountain lakes after Malla.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/657/21956959992_78d9076ee2_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/657/21956959992_c7a103307f_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="7" title="Walk from Treriksröset" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>7. The huge cracked boulder meant I was fairly close, although not as close as I imagined. </p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/683/21969136005_6222c071b4_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/683/21969136005_0bbec4f8f5_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="8" title="Walk from Treriksröset" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>8. Descend through a pretty birch forest and...</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/600/21978932711_dc9bd33067_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/600/21978932711_8589994878_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="9" title="Treriksröset trailhead parking lot" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>9. It was finally over.  I don't think I had ever been so happy to see my car before.
    Having walked 23 km on a mountain trail with no major stops, I was utterly exhausted,
    and despite thick soles my feet hurt badly after walking on all kinds of rocks.  My boots
    and jeans were also caked with mud up to knee level, which was annoying.  I changed into
    my usual running shoes, but I had no spare pants and couldn't really clean my jeans at the moment.
    Then I remembered about that washing machine left behind in Äkäslompolo cabin 250 km away.
    Well hopefully no one would think I'm retarded because of my muddy jeans
    during my detour in Norway, before I get
    back to Äkäslompolo.
</p>

<p>The time was 18:20, so I had a little over an hour and a half remaining (or so I thought
    at the moment).  After resting for a bit staring at one more nearby reindeer herd, I drove
    away towards Norway.  One more thing I love about driving is that you can be extremely exhausted
    from walking (or say feeling bloated after a big meal) but still be perfectly able to drive several
    hundred kilometers more, just because being exhausted from walking and being exhausted from
    driving are two completely unrelated conditions.</p> 

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5805/21978948051_07b0791436_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5805/21978948051_f36e423f00_c.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="10" title="E8 customs station" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>10. Less than a kilometer from a parking lot, there was a customs station.  It is located
    on the Finnish side of the border, but both Finnish and Norwegian personnel are stationed
    there.  A customs officer (probably Norwegian but it didn't occur to me to look closely)
    actually ordered me to stop, asked for my passport, inquired
    where I was going, and had a brief look into my trunk.  I didn't mind in the slightest.
    I can't help feeling a little uneasy each time I cross the border from Russia to Finland,
    but the other borders feel perfectly safe and friendly in comparison.  Also, I actually
    had experienced a full search of my (rental) car, with a dog and everything, the previous
    year on the Swedish-Norwegian border, and the officers there were perfectly polite and
    respectful and even apologetic when it turned out we weren't carrying any drugs after all.  
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/717/21348049623_2f3c0221b2_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/717/21348049623_8eee2cdf3a_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="11" title="Welcome to Norway" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>11. Welcome to Norway!  You can tell it's Norway by the white background of the signs;
    it's yellow in Finland and Sweden.  (90 km/h limitation is also never used in Finland,
    it's either 80 km/h or 100 km/h.)  Of course there was a border cairn and some signs,
    but I stopped to take pictures of them only on my way back the following day.
    Administratively, it was Storfjord Municipality of Troms County of Norway.
</p>

<p>The watershed between Baltic Sea (which is a basin of the Atlantic Ocean) and Arctic Ocean
    more or less follows the border, and from here, about 550 m above sea level, Northern
    Lights Road began slowly descending.  Pretty soon I spotted a river to the left of me
    again; it was Skibotnelva.  Starting as a relatively small mountain stream, it soon
    turned into a huge canyon.</p>
    

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/701/21978994811_93663ce5d3_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/701/21978994811_e5f248178f_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="12" title="Parking lot in Norway" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>12. It was pretty dark already and I didn't stop much; this was about the only stop I made
    on my way towards the Lyngenfjord.
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/635/21969229245_4b476e362e_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/635/21969229245_dc117261a6_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="13" title="Salmon parasite" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>13. A big sign at that parking lot warned about a salmon parasite.  It is not dangerous
    to humans in any way, but it is pretty horrible for freshwater fish, and lots of Norway 
    rivers are infested with it.  So the sign tells you how to avoid accidentally bringing
    this parasite to other rivers. 
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5795/21781145160_54b582628c_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5795/21781145160_4298798f3b_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="14" title="Skibotn" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>14. The E8 road ends at a rather uninspired-looking intersection with Route E6, on the shore
    of the fjord.  E6 here also looks unimpressive, but it is <i>the</i> trunk road of Norway,
    going all the way from Swedish border through Oslo, Trondheim, and some other major cities,
    all the way to Kirkenes far in the northeast, near the Russian border at the Kola Peninsula.
    The vast majority of the E6 is still an ordinary two-lane highway; the traffic and the
    conditions just do not warrant building anything better.     
</p>

<p>Turning right onto the E6, I almost immediately entered a small town of Skibotn
    <i>(Norw. Ship Bottom, as in "bottom of the fjord")</i>.  With a population of 570,
    Skibotn does not really qualify as a town, although it definitely looked bigger than
    Kilpisjärvi or Kaaresuvanto/Karesuando.</p> 

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/738/21781153200_aa68eed8b2_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/738/21781153200_bd6eafd546_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="15" title="Evening Lyngenfjord" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>15. I was very eager to have a look at the fjord, and stopped on a pier in Skibotn.
    Well, this was it.  Lyngenfjord is the largest fjord of Troms County, at 82 km long.
    Its width does not exceed 10 kilometers.  Skibotn is located at its eastern shore;
    I never visited its western shore but it has some pretty big moutains (up to 1833 m high),
    known as Lyngen Alps, and visible in this picture.  
</p>

<p>Somewhere in these Lyngen Alps are the remains of the Lyngen Line, a line of bunkers
    and other fortifications (not unlike Mannerheim Line or Salpa Line in Finland) actually
    built <i>after</i> World War II, to shield Norway against the possible Soviet invasion.  
    A perfectly reasonable move for the Norwegians, I'd say, given the post-war developments
    in Europe.  You can't drive around Lyngen Alps which stretch down to the Swedish border,
    and there are only a few usable valleys and mountain passes there, so the location would
    be relatively easy to defend against an invasion from the east.  Luckily for everyone
    such an invasion never materialized.</p> 

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5691/21348161313_ac9c107859_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5691/21348161313_8e6a080bb2_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="16" title="Skibotn pier" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>16. The pier at Skibotn.  The hour was late, and the weather and the sea looked very
    unhospitable, so I didn't actually go down to the water to have a taste of the Arctic
    Ocean until the next day. </p>
    
<p>Actually it's disputable whether I had really been at the Arctic Ocean, because there are
    several different definitions of where that ocean starts.  The Norwegians, I think,
    generally think that the Arctic Ocean starts to the north of the Lofoten Islands.  
    That would place Lyngenfjord firmly in the Arctic Ocean of course.  On the other hand,
    Norwegian Sea stretches as far to the northeast as the North Cape, and Lyngenfjord
    belongs to the Norwegian Sea, and Norwegian Sea is generally considered a sea of the
    Atlantic Ocean.   Well anyway, for all practical purposes I <i>was</i> at the shore of the
        Arctic Ocean, and significantly beyond the Arctic Circle.</p>
        
<p>For some reason I assumed Birtavarre Camping would be very close to Skibotn, and hadn't
    bothered to type it into the navigation app to make sure beforehand.  I was dismayed to learn
    it was in some more 50 kilometers away, at the bottom of the Kåfjord, a fairly small branch of the
    Lyngenfjord.  Well, time for some night driving.  I drove on the fjord coast through three
    tunnels before seeing a sign for Birtavarre Camping.  On the brighter side, I had completely
    forgotten about time zones!  Norway is in a different time zone from Finland, and despite
    entering it from south to north, I still had to move my clocks an hour earlier, which meant
    I had an extra hour until 20:00 when the camping reception supposedly closed.</p>
    
<p>The camping looked small, especially in the rain after dark.  I had some doubts about
    whether I was at the right place, as the signs said simply "Birtavarre Camping", while
    the place I had booked at Booking.com was named "High-North Birtavarre Camping".  I stopped
    near the reception building and went out to ask.  The reception was locked, but there was
    an envelope pinned on a board outside.  It had my name, number of my cabin,
    and contained a key inside.  It looked like I hadn't needed to worry about being on time
    after all.</p>
    
<p>My cabin was number 9, and there were about twenty in total, scattered around some
    meadows which were drenched and had huge puddles already in the rain.  No one camped with
    a tent, and there were only two or three motorhomes.  Most of the cabins didn't seem
    occupied either.  Still, I had some difficulty locating cabin 9.  The numbers were assigned
    seemingly completely at random, and number 9 was literally the last cabin I checked.</p>
    
<p>I parked my car on the meadow outside, unlocked the cabin, and brought my stuff inside.  
    At that moment, some black Audi pulled up, and a man stepped out, shook my hand and asked
    whether I had had any problems.  That was the owner of the camping site, of course.  I went with
    him to pay for my cabin, and he wished me good night.</p>

<p>The cabin was small but furnished better than I expected.  In particular it had a small kitchen,
    which I immediately used to warm up some microwave burgers.  As I discovered, there are
    at least two varietes of microwaveable burgers in Finnish supermarkets.  The first costs
    &euro;1-2, and it's pretty much a patty in a bun without any other ingridients.  These
    tasted pretty horrible.  The second kind of burgers costs &euro;2-3, and includes a sealed
    satchet with some yellow sauce, which you have to squeze out inside a burger before microwaving
    it.  This sauce or whatever it was actually made the whole thing taste like an acceptable
    cheeseburger, maybe still on the shittier side, but perfectly edible and even somewhat
    enjoyable.  Again, I wonder why Russian supermarkets don't stock microwaveable burgers.
    Just microwaveable pizza.  I tried buying some many years ago back in college, and I still
    have nightmares about that pizza.</p>
    
<p>The cabin of course didn't have a toilet or a shower; these belonged to a separate building.
    I was lucky my cabin had been right next to it.  I intended to take a shower, feeling sweaty
    and filthy after that Treriksröset walk.  My hopes were shattered when I saw that the showers
    required a 10 Norwegian Krone coin to operate.  I would have paid five times that but where
    would I find Norwegian Krones in cash?  I didn't even have many euros in cash; Nordic countries
    accept cards pretty much everywhere and I was kind of spoiled by that.  Well, it was their
    loss that I ended up going to bed without a shower.</p>
    
<p>A more pleasant surprise was that the camping actually had a perfect Wi-Fi connection. 
    I wouldn't have expected a small camping site to have any sort of Internet at all.  So I ended up wasting the rest of my evening and the entire following morning online.</p>  
   
<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5745/21943161576_e7af85cb19_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5745/21943161576_5beba04639_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="17" title="Birtavarre Camping" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>17. This is what the camping looked like in the morning.  My cabin is to the right of
    the car, and the larger building in the foreground is where showers/toilets are.  A river flowed just
    beyond the camping, not visible here due to the trees.  As seems to be common in Norwegian fjords, the names of the river,
    its valley, and the fjord that continues it are the same: Kåfjordelva, Kåfjorddalen, and
    Kåfjord.  
</p>

<p>The mountain in the background which forms the southeastern wall of Kåfjord and Kåfjorddalen is Isfjellet
    <i>(Norw. Icy Mountain, incidentally same word as "iceberg")</i>.  Its highest point
    is 1375 m high, but of course you cannot really see higher parts of Isfjellet here because
    of low cloud cover.  It's a shame, because Troms County is generally an unusually dry
    and sunny place for Norway.  The river flowing down from Isfjellet in the distance and forming
    a waterfall is named Okselva.</p>   

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/604/21979096721_3bc6f78529_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/604/21979096721_f2b6424bcd_c.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="18" title="Birtavarre Camping cabin" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>18. Last look inside a cabin at Birtavarre Camping.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5621/21781471818_c4e907e04b_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5621/21781471818_93fb1d505d_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="19" title="Birtavarre Camping cabin" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>19. As far as toilet-less cabins go, this one was really quite nice.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5646/21943170866_39c8543b52_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5646/21943170866_c3c99a5623_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="20" title="Birtavarre Camping trash bins" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>20. I threw out my trash in one of these bins.  I like the way their lids are held
    on against the winds by stones.
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5694/21348228443_88e7e26f83_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5694/21348228443_1a37ed002a_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="21" title="Leaving Birtavarre" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>21. Time to go!  I spent that entire morning considered various routes, and the idea
    I finally came up with was simply to keep driving north until I reach the 70th parallel,
    and then go back via the same road.  So this is where I turned right, onto E6 Route
    towards the northernmost parts of the country.  I wonder why Narvik is signposted for
    the opposite direction rather than Tromsø; Tromsø is closer and it's much larger city.
    Unlike Narvik it's not located right on the E6 Route though.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5778/21781279640_a8dd7c52d5_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5778/21781279640_4bfd144c4e_c.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="22" title="Kåfjord" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>22. First stop on E6 along Kåfjord, in Trollvik village.  E6 Route in Northern Norway
    basically traces the contours
    of every fjord, only occasionally making a shortcut through some valley.  As a result road
    distances are quite significant.  I wonder how often do the inhabitants of these villages
    get out of their area.  I mean you'd be probably bored to tears even of these amazing
    fjord landscapes after some twenty years or so, but it would take a very long drive to get
    anywhere, even in Tromsø.  Norway has a network of small airports though, and this probably
    helps somewhat.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5662/21781286430_9939173145_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5662/21781286430_478686d6bc_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="23" title="Isfjelltunnelen" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>23. Isfjelltunnelen <i>(Norw. Ice Mountain Tunnel)</i>, a 3.2 km tunnel on E6 along
Kåfjord.  Mountains in fjords often rise steeply right from the water level, leaving no
usable land, and even building a shore road around them is difficult.  This particular
strech of road around Isfjellet was prone to avalanches, hence the tunnel.  The streams
running down from the mountain are Indre and Ytre Iselva <i>(Norw. Inner, Outer Ice River)</i>.</p>

<p>24. Birtavarre and Kåfjorddalen valley.</p>

<p>25. Driving on along Kåfjord.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/742/21957313502_59b86dc902_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/742/21957313502_a13d32b079_c.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="26" title="Kåfjord" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>26. Roads in Norway, like in Finland or Sweden, don't really have a shoulder, but still there  
    are usually ample opportunities to stop in any mildly scenic places.  Only the largest
    designated rest areas get the familiar "spruce and picnic table" sign, and usually there's
    not even a P-sign, but there's still enough place to pull over safely. </p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/590/21957442382_2a60c24b27_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/590/21957442382_cb56753d8c_c.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="27" title="Nordmannvik" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>27. I left Kåfjord and drove on along the eastern coast of the huge Lyngenfjord.  
    Administratively this is still Kåfjord Municipality though, its center being Olderdalen
    town.</p>
    
<p>While Norway doesn't generally have bilingual signs, Kåfjord Municipality 
    is officially referred to as Gáivuotna-Kåfjord, Gáivuotna being its Sami name.  <i>Kåfjord</i>
    is in fact simply the "Norwegianized" version of <i>Gáivuotna</i> word; <i>vuotna</i> means
    "fjord" and no one is sure what <i>gái</i> means.  The total population of Kåfjord is about
    2200, supposedly with a large fraction of Sami, although I couldn't find exact numbers.
    A Sami music and culture festival named Riddu Riđđu is held in Manndalen village in Kåfjord
    every summer.  First held in 1991, it was sort of a reaction to Sami discrimination (or,
    more properly, assimilation), which
    Norway sadly had a long tradition of.  The policy on Sami reversed only in the 1980s, following
    massive Sami protests against the construction of hydroelectric dam at Alta.  King Harald V
    officially apologized before the Sami for the history of Norwegianization in 1997.

<p>28. At the mouth of Vikelva river in Nordmannvik village.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/612/21347015094_5146daf957_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/612/21347015094_9a4dfa8da1_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="29" title="Lyngenfjord" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>29. Lyngen Alps on the west coast of Lyngenfjord are still hidden in the clouds. </p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/657/21957621582_24f73835c1_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/657/21957621582_40ca34d15f_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="30" title="Road 866" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>30. Route E6 cuts through a narrow isthmus and continues on to the east towards Finnmark 
    County and the city of Alta.  I turned left onto Road 866 here, driving on towards
    Kågen and Skjervøya islands.  The 70th parallel north, as far as I could tell from
    examining maps in the morning, goes right across the bridge between Kågen and Skjervøya.
    This crossroads is located in the next municipality, Nordreisa.   
</p>

<p>Road 866 is designated as <i>Fylkesvei</i> <i>(Norw. County Road; abbreviated as Fv.)</i>.
Norway has a somewhat chaotic road numbering system very similar to Sweden, distinguishing
European Routes (E-designation), National Roads (Riksvei, Rv.), County Roads (Fylkesvei, Fv.), and 
other roads,
municipal and the like.  National Roads and County Roads are in practice difficult to distinguish;
they both have white signs with black numbers, one to three digits long.  Less important roads
generally have greater numbers.  Local roads are not signposted.  Despite often very difficult
terrain virtually all roads seem to be paved, although they are often narrow, even one-lane in some
cases.  Tunnels are also extremely common.  Norway roads are slow and sometimes dangerous-looking,
but the network seems to be pretty much as dense as physically possible.</p> 

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5708/21782892349_eeb1d1a24a_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5708/21782892349_78dee7a464_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="31" title="Unidentified fjord" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>31. I could not place this picture on the map.  Maybe I messed up their order.  </p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5750/21943639546_a3777ae69a_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5750/21943639546_84416bc56e_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="32" title="Reisafjorden" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>32. The first half of Road 866 runs along a long peninsula squeezed between Lyngenfjord and
    a smaller irregularly-shaped fjord named Reisafjord.  This is Reisafjord; the landmasses 
    to the right are a small mountain named Latterfjellet, and Bonnikaholmen islet to the left of it.  The village on the far side of the fjord is Storvik.
    
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/601/21957744762_09733ed072_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/601/21957744762_3006ae7e33_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="33" title="Gjøvarden" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>33. The impressive-looking flat-topped mountain hanging over Road 866 is named Gjøvarden
    (532 m).  There is a small rest area with a good view on it, and a trail to the summit
    of Gjøvarden starts here -- it is visible under two small orange signs on a tree to the left.
    The trail is only 2.2 km long (although rather steep), and I regretted not having enough time
    to climb the mountain.  Interestingly, this particular trail seems to have been established
    fairly recently; there are no traces of it in Google Street View (which has panoramas
    of Road 866 as of August 2010), and the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.norgeskart.no/">online map of Norway</a>, which by the way is quite great
    (how do you think I know the names of all these mountains and the like?), doesn't show it 
    either.
</p>

<p>34. Road 866 weaving behind.  You can see it's narrow enough to have no centerline;
    it's no big deal, even some stretches of the E6 Route are like that.  The width is enough to
    pass an oncoming semi while only being a little bit scared.  There are some narrower
    roads too, of course. 
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/591/21957789392_a4cfe35127_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/591/21957789392_b2f62e5834_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="35" title="Road 866" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>35. Another place I failed to locate.
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5747/21347253474_3f7aa3088b_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5747/21347253474_584d5f01d9_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="36" title="Kågen Island" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>36. Soon afterwards Road 866 dives underground, into an undersea 
    tunnel named Maursundtunnelen, connecting
    a mid-sized island named Kågen to the mainland.  The 2122 m long tunnel goes under a strait named
    Maursundet, 850 m wide, at the depth of 92.5 m under sea level.  The tunnel is quite
    steep and scary; I had to downshift to go through it safely.  At least it was wide
    enough to accomodate two regular lanes.  There was no way I could take the picture of the
    tunnel itself, but after the tunnel I could stop and actually walk down to the sea shore,
    which I had wanted to do since the previous way.  So, yep, this is where I tasted the Arctic
    Ocean.  Quite salty, as expected, and completely unlike Baltic Sea, which tastes almost
    like freshwater.  I gathered a few small purplish sea shells on this rocky beach to bring
    them back from the trip.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5827/21957862062_f9d8c4569f_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5827/21957862062_f4db0b5f04_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="37" title="Kågentunnelen" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>37. The mouth of the last tunnel on my way north, the Kågentunnelen.  It is 1737 m long
    and it's a fairly calm drive; this is an avalanche protection tunnel, not an undersea one.
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/642/21347294364_d8cfd916e9_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/642/21347294364_db3da1263c_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="38" title="Ferry landing" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>38. A seemingly unused ferry landing near Kågentunnelen.  The destinations mentioned,
    Havnnes and Rotsund, refer to a ferry crossing to Uløya, an island pretty similar to Kågen 
    in size but lacking a road connection to the mainland.  It would be a very long detour
    to visit both Kågen and Uløya though.  It seems likely this landing (named Flåten)
    fell into disuse after the opening of Maursundtunnelen in 1991, but it doesn't seem
    completely abandoned.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5748/21943878966_e8496a0b92_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5748/21943878966_acebbcc861_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="39" title="Skattørsundet" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>39. And here I am at the last island I visited, named Skjervøya.  It is connected to
    Kågen not by a tunnel but by a bridge over Skattørsundet strait.  After turning onto
    the bridge I realized that it had only a single lane, and that a semi truck was entering
    it from the opposite direction.  I briefly panicked, but then noticed that the bridge
    had a passing point in a small widening in the middle where I could safely wait
    for the semi.</p>
    
<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/775/21958051322_406be338c1_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/775/21958051322_d6cdb3a700_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="40" title="On Skjervøya" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>40. View from Skjervøya onto Kågen.  Skjervøya is not the northernmost island; I could drive on without turning onto the bridge, and reach Laukøya and Arnøya islands from Kågen using a ferry.
    Arnøya is the northernmost island of this particular archipelago which probably doesn't have
    any particular name, so I'll call it Road 866 Archipelago.    </p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5828/21980042451_a1d45f37db_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5828/21980042451_8f3f280193_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="41" title="Skjervøya vegetation" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>41. The bridge lies on the 70th parallel north, and thus I reached the destination I had chosen
    in the morning.  The part of Skjervøya near the bridge has tundra-like treeless zone
    starting right at the sea level, but most of Skjervøya is still forested.  Northern Norway
    generally has very mild climate for its latitudes due to proximity of ocean and Gulf Stream.
    Notrably, it is significantly warmer than Lapland.
    The treeline eventually gets lower, but only the northernmost fjords in Finnmark County
    (where North Cape, the northernmost point of Europe, is located) are completely treeless.  
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5759/21944006056_8c844a3419_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5759/21944006056_1df44fde39_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="42" title="Skattørsundet" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>42. Still, the 70th parallel north is pretty far.  Excluding Northern Norway itself
    (Finnmark Country and the northernmost parts of Troms County), there are virtually no
    permanently inhabited places north of 70&deg; N.  Even in Russia only Yamal and Taymyr are
    beyond the 70th parallel -- the places also known as endless nasty frozen tundra which isn't good
    for anything other than drilling for oil and gas.  Notably, Kola Peninsula is entirely
    southwards of 70&deg; N.  So is nearly all of Alaska, apart from its northern coast, which
    as far as I know is only inhabited for oil too.  So, not taking into account various
    uninhabited Arctic archipelagoes, only Svalbard Archipelago (which belongs to Norway too)
    and some minor villages on Greenland coast remain.  
</p>

<p>Still, I believe there are <a target="_blank" href="http://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/22095/do-airlines-fly-directly-over-the-north-pole">some transcontinental flights</a> that go through the vicinity of the
    North Pole; sometimes it's just the shortest way.  Which makes a casual person significantly
    more likely to travel (briefly) beyond the 70th parallel north in their life. </p>
    
<p>Myself, I 
    hadn't taken any transcontinental flights so far, so I decided to take home another memento
    from my own northernmost point ever visited.  I looked around a bit and found a large and very flat rock, about 30 cm wide
    and 3 cm thick, and decided that it would suit just perfectly.  It took some effort to lug
    it from this tundra into my trunk, and when some car appeared on the bridge
    I dropped the rock and pretended
    I wasn't doing anything.  It wasn't a police car and I don't believe bringing large rocks from
    parts of Norway which aren't national parks is forbidden, but I still felt like I was doing something
    illegal.  Nonetheless I'm happy to report I brought this rock to St. Petersburg successfully
    and it serves me as a small tabletop.</p>       

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/739/21970337985_389905bbd0_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/739/21970337985_962833bde4_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="43" title="Road to Skjervøy" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>43. As for Skjervøya, it's a relatively small island, only a few kilometers long, much smaller
    than Kågen or Arnøya, and lacking great mountains.  Skjervøya however is the capital of "Road 866
    Archipelago" of sorts; it has a town named Skjervøy where 2300 people of the total 2800
    population of Skjervøy Municipality live.  </p>
    
<p>I didn't have the time to visit Skjervøy though, and so I turned around and drove back south.
    I had to cover 430 kilometers to get back to my cabin at Äkäslompolo.  For some reason I didn't
    feel worried about having to drive after dark at all, but still I had to go.  To be continued.</p>
