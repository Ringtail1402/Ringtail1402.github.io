<p>It feels cool to stand at the edge of the world.  Only there's no edge here
    as such and the world still continues on, but you get the idea.  But anyway the 70th parallel North
    sounds like a suitably impressive achievement.  And now I guess it's time to turn around.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/649/21349199633_660bc990e0_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/649/21349199633_a6709528be_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="1" title="Leaving Skjervøya" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>1. Leaving Skjervøya island again, on the same one-lane bridge.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5729/21944173216_c692dbc81b_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5729/21944173216_6bdc12e97d_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="2" title="Road 866" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>2. Mainland part of Road 866.   I guess these barriers close in case of
    avalanche. </p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/686/21980193811_2326cd1d19_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/686/21980193811_321d9a0398_c.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="3" title="Route E6" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>3. Lyngenfjord near Olderdalen town.  The sky got a tiny bit brighter.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5797/21970423855_1dd15ef023_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5797/21970423855_7eba1050cb_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="4" title="Olderdalen ferry" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>4. A ferry shortcut can take you here from Olderdalen to Lyngseidet on the other side
    of the fjord, at the foot of the Lyngen Alps, and another ferry (Svensby-Breivikeidet)
    will get you fairly close to Tromsø.  Driving distance from Olderdalen to Tromsø with 
    these ferries is 90 km, and the regular route around fjords is 180 km.  For me, taking this
    ferry didn't make much sense, and besides, unlike Finland and Sweden, Norwegian road ferries
    are not free.  This one costs 150 krones (~&euro;15) per regular-sized car with driver,
    with additional 50 krones per passenger.
</p>

<p>5. </p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/635/21349562583_3d4e717152_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/635/21349562583_ed7a2dd3ac_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="6" title="Kåfjord" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>6. Tracing the Kåfjord again.  This is one of the places where even the E6 road gets
    fairly narrow.
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5666/21348030664_7ba1e1358b_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5666/21348030664_49f4f43f13_c.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="7" title="Rest area near Skardalstunnelen" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>7. A large full-fledged roadside rest area between Isfjell and Skardalen tunnels, at the foot
    of Isfjell mountain.
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5827/21980567111_6fd17e7e76_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5827/21980567111_fc2a631a2a_c.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="8" title="Rest area near Skardalstunnelen" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>8. Isfjell and the Sandero. </p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5642/21958663992_9e6e52cb81_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5642/21958663992_86b231a1a2_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="9" title="Tunnel under construction" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>9. One more tunnel is just being built, at Manndalen village.  This one I believe
    would significantly cut travel time, going under Nordnesfjell mountain instead of around it.
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/699/21958771052_4603861aac_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/699/21958771052_11983920e3_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="10" title="Lyngenfjord" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>10. Kåfjord left behind, driving near Lyngenfjord again.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/687/21783088228_9c9c3b53b7_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/687/21783088228_e2669de0f0_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="11" title="Rest area" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>11. A smaller rest area.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/676/21980751511_06ef8a2507_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/676/21980751511_a793f09542_c.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="12" title="Lyngenfjord" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>12. The weather almost got nearly okay!  Too bad I'm leaving already.  Do you know
    it's sometimes possible to spot actual whales in this fjord?  Humpback whales and orcas, I believe. 
    Now I want to go back and try to spot at least one.
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5796/21958893872_0634093169_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5796/21958893872_6a129057f4_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="13" title="Gas station" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>13. Refuelling at Skibotn.  As you know Norway is a ridiculously expensive country.
    Probably due to the fact they have their own oil, Norwegian gas is not "ridiculously
    expensive" but merely "very expensive".  I had enough gas remaining to last until Finland
    in theory, but what if the gas station at Kilpisjärvi will be closed for some reason?
    Even though these are not really wild lands, the distance between gas stations is considerable.</p>

<p>The gas station is automatic, as are most Nordic gas stations (and as a mildly sociophobic
    person I'm glad for that).  It however refused to accept one of my cards -- good thing
    I had another.  It turned out that bank (Locko Bank, a relatively minor Russian bank where
    I happen to have a car loan and a credit card with a small limit) locked the card due to
    transactions at "suspicious locations", without even warning me.  The funny thing is that
    Finland and Sweden apparently were perfectly fine with that bank.</p> 

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/625/21348308304_de335d2d64_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/625/21348308304_8fc20b0d4b_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="14" title="E8 Route" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>14. Goodbye fjords!  Back onto the Northern Lights Road (E8 route), southbound into the
     mountains.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/645/21958934162_263814106b_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/645/21958934162_13073d7a6a_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="15" title="Skibotndalen valley" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>15. This time I could make a few stops along the way, and enjoy some views of the deep
    Skibotnelva river valley (Skibotndalen).  The mountainous river, known as Ivgojohka in the Sami
    language, has a hydroelectric dam somewhere closer to its mouth.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5631/21945052806_344934d253_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5631/21945052806_619d8f8781_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="16" title="Gálggojávri Lake" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>16. At the rest area right before the Finnish-Norwegian border you can enjoy views
    of Gálggojávri lake <i>(no non-Sami name exists)</i>, the source of Skibotnelva.
    The elevation is about 500 m above sea level.  We're back in tundra-like areas
    typical for Käsivarsi region.  </p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/767/21981032001_ace35fb6f3_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/767/21981032001_8913f9b7cf_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="17" title="Reindeer skull" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>17. An actual reindeer skull!  Just lying around in the tundra near the rest area!
    I must admit I was really tempted to bring this thing back with me.  It appeared however 
    that some small bits of meat still remained on it, and I was not particularly eager
    to learn some practical bone maceration.  And I'm pretty sure the customs would not
    allow it in any case.  Still that was a goddamn beautiful skull.  
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5741/21348563454_0e9fedbeda_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5741/21348563454_7288c94594_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="18" title="Norwegian border" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>18. And this is the actual border, the Norwegian side...</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5784/21783463978_02e1192897_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5784/21783463978_d76dbdf700_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="19" title="Finnish border" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>19. ...and the Finnish side.  Reindeer, likely the same herd as the day before, were
    blocking the road before the customs building, but a semi truck driving before me
    made them go away. </p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/670/21348624154_f801bbf3d6_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/670/21348624154_b623c87f6f_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="20" title="Muotkatakka pass" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>20. Muotkatakka pass near Kilpisjärvi village is the highest point of the public Finnish
    road network, at 565 m high.  
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/610/21981179761_94360fb59c_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/610/21981179761_c7f0c8c85c_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="21" title="Northern Lights Road" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>21. I still had a lot of driving to do to get back to Äkäslompolo.  I still didn't hit 
    any reindeer but at some point later
    in the twilight I hit some slow pigeon-sized bird with my right headlight.  It impacted my 
    windshield then, and fell down in a bog to the right of the road.  By the time I processed
    what happened and stopped it was hopeless to try to find it.  The car was undamaged
    but the bird was likely badly wounded or killed.  I thought about finishing it off, but, apart
    from difficulty of locating the body, I really have no idea how exactly should you do
    such a thing.  The largest creature I ever killed was a nasty slug from Sweden, and even that
    was unintentional.
</p>

<p>After Kaaresuvanto it got completely dark.  I didn't make any stops and the trip was
    uneventful, up until that narrow one-lane road just before Äkäslompolo, Road 940.  
    Some hare or rabbit jumped out of the shadows onto the road right before me.  I tried
    to shift aside as much as it was possible and hit the brakes, but I still would have hit
    that hare if it didn't hop away at the last second.  Running over a hare would have
    made me very sad, I love hares and rabbits and in fact keep a white spotted male rabbit
    myself.  He's a mischievous but very amiable little critter.</p>     

<p>I was home at 21:30.  Shower at last!  And I was able to wash my muddy jeans too.  Although
    the cabin lacked any washing detergent, washing them in the machine with plain
    water worked fine.</p> 

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5808/21959267602_04d21f36b6_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5808/21959267602_585ce80523_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="22" title="Last day at Äkäslompolo" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>22. For my last day spent in Lapland, I decided against any serious hikes or drives.
    I mostly stayed at the cabin, sorting through pictures from Norway, and walked to the 
    shore of Äkäslompolo lake and sat down there for a bit.  And of course there was the
    most important thing remaining, souvenir shopping.
</p>

<p>I didn't buy many souvenirs, in fact.  First of all I wanted to get some cloudberry
    liqueur.  I went to Alko store at Jounin Kauppas mall to look for it.  Most berry liqueurs
    I saw there were actually bottled in Turku -- in fact you can buy them in St. Petersburg
    in Finnish supermarket chains (Prisma or K-Ruoka).  It took me some effort to find
    the liqueur which actually was made in Lapland -- in Ylläsjärvi, I believe.  
    Its bottles were a lot smaller and more expensive than those of regular Turku liqueur,
    at some &euro;19 per bottle.  Nonetheless I bought two, intending to drink one of them with
    my girlfriend and another with my parents with whom I usually spend new year holidays.</p>
    
<p>I also bought some postcards (that was the first time I tried sending postcards while
    travelling), fridge magnets, and more importantly, reindeer droppings.  I mean there were
    these little bags which literally had "reindeer droppings" written on them.  How could I
    resist?  I thought that was some sort of traditional medicine or something.  So imagine
    my disappointment when I returned to St. Petersburg and discovered that these were just some
    reindeer dropping-shaped chocolate candies.  My girlfriend promptly ate all of them.</p> 

<p>At the cabin I took out that guestbook and wrote down three pages of my experiences in English.
    I went to bed a bit earlier, setting the alarm clock for 3:45 in the morning.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/misc-img/akaslompolo-alt-route.png" width="272" height="615"
    alt="Alternate Äkäslompolo-St. Petersburg route"
    title="Alternate Äkäslompolo-St. Petersburg route" class="pull-right img-thumbnail"></p>
    
<p>The weather in that last day took a turn to the worse.  The temperature dropped to some
    +2&nbsp;&deg;C or so, and it snowed lightly from time to time.  I was afraid that the roads
    would get icy, especially in the early morning, and walking out of the cabin and finding my
    car completely encased in ice after a freezing rain didn't exactly lessen
    my fears.  Of course I didn't have winter tyres on yet -- in fact I hadn't even bought
    a winter tyre set at that point (and they don't make all that much difference on black ice
    anyway).  Still, I decided to go.  I put all my stuff in the trunk, took out trash,
    turned out the lights, locked the door, and left the key at the same tiny box it had originally
    been in.  Then, after getting to the car (which took some effort due to that ice; good thing
    it has a "immediately turn on the heater and windshield heating at maximum power" button
    at least) I drove away
    very slowly and carefully.</p>
    
<p>The roads looked wet, which was not a good sign, and the temperature was about &minus;1&nbsp;&deg;C,
    which was not a good sign either.  I drove to Kellokas nature center first to throw the 
    postcards into the mailbox (as I remembered there was one outside the building there) at 15-20&nbsp;km/h,
    and tried to stomp on the brakes a few times at a very low speed on straight stretches
    of the road.  The car seemed to handle alright.  Nonetheless I didn't raise my speed above
    40&nbsp;km/h until the road began to look a bit drier at least.  I have no idea whether that
    would have helped if I actually struck some black ice at some unfortunate bend.
    Generally I tend to react to all uncomfortable driving conditions with the "drive slower"
    strategy.  Which is usually a great idea except that driving slower tends to make you
    build up a trail of angry drivers behind which are more confident in their driving skills and
    want to overtake you really badly.  But in this case I met only one or two cars in these
    morning hours until I reached the Northern Lights Road and Kolari.</p>
    
<p>I always try to take another route on the return trip wherever it's reasonably possible,
    and this time was no exception.  First, I wanted to drive the Kolari-Tornio stretch not
    via the Northern Lights Road, but via a detour through Sweden.  On the Swedish side
    of the Torne valley there is a twin road to the Finnish Northern Lights Road, called simply
    Riksväg 99 <i>(Swed. National Road)</i>.  The main difference is that it does not continue
    into Norway; rather, it ends at Karesuando, at the last bridge to Finland.  The distance
    via Swedish Road 99 is not significantly greater than via the Northern Lights Road.</p>
    
<p>Second, I wanted to drive all the way from Oulu to Imatra not on the crowded Roads 4 and
    5, but rather on Roads 22 and 6, through Kajaani and Joensuu (well, bypassing Kajanni
    using some local roads through Vuokatti, but you get the idea).  This route is about 80&nbsp;km
    longer, and the total distance from Äkäslompolo to St. Petersburg exceeded 1200&nbsp;km, but
    I expected (correctly) that these roads will be very quiet and pleasant to drive.</p>
    
<p>So, near Kolari I drove onto a bridge to Sweden.  There were no border guards.  The place
    on the Swedish side of the border is named Kaunisjoensuu which means "Beautiful River
    Mouth" in Finnish; it appears that a lot of place names in the Torne valley are in Finnish
    even on the Swedish side.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5652/21971479815_894d74a6a7_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5652/21971479815_2f2cbdddc7_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="23" title="Swedish Road 99 before dawn" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>23. In Kaunisjoensuu you actually get not on the Road 99 itself, but rather, on Road 403,
    which connects to Road 99 in a town named Pajala.  Here's what Road 99 looks like in Pajala
    before dawn.  By that point the road became dry enough I was able to drive close to the speed
    limit.  The speed limit on rural Swedish roads in the north is normally 100&nbsp;km/h, while it is 
    only 90&nbsp;km/h in the more populated parts of the country.  I wonder where the divide
    passes.  
</p>

<p>24. A bridge over Torne river on Road 403 in Pajala. </p>

<p>25. I completely forgot that I was supposed to pass the Arctic Circle again on my way
    south.  Here it runs through a village named Juoksengi.  
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/600/21784615689_72f858da94_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/600/21784615689_cbabf2a072_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="26" title="Arctic Circle in Sweden" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>26. The Swedish rest area on the Arctic Circle is equipped better than its
    Finnish counterpart.  As I already noticed in my trip into Sweden a few months before,
    Sweden has some really great rest areas.</p>

<p>27. Fiery dawn over the Torne river.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5637/21783457450_d40a6d92a0_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5637/21783457450_fdd21f79e9_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="28" title="Dawn over Road 99" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>28. Road 99 at dawn.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5625/21783505850_3d3279b2bd_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5625/21783505850_6b9b77d4c7_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="29" title="Rapids on Torne river" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>29. Rapids on the Torne river.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5821/21784732329_dc578209e1_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5821/21784732329_a1eba15106_c.jpg" width="800" height="533" alt="30" title="Road 99" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>30. Driving on.  The rest of the way until Haparanda was not especially remarkable.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5672/21350517613_0f59cf6c72_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5672/21350517613_017d0a7778_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="31" title="Haparanda" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>31. Entering the town of Haparanda.  Haparanda is smaller than the neighboring Finnish
    Tornio (5,000 vs. 22,000 population), but it doesn't really look all that small.
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5805/21959504342_9fcb664ddf_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5805/21959504342_c96a8419ae_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="32" title="Ikea in Haparanda" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>32. One of the main attractions in Haparanda for the residents of Tornio is the
    northernmost Ikea in the world.  I kind of wanted to try their meatballs, but the hour
    was too early.  I read somewhere that people drive to this Ikea from as far as Murmansk,
    Russia (a 700&nbsp;km drive). 
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5764/21945500956_17fc2a3fa6_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5764/21945500956_912b8e255e_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="33" title="Road E4 in Haparanda" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>33. Right before the Finnish border.  Route E4 is the backbone road of Sweden, somewhat
    similar to Finnish Road 4, running from Helsingborg in the south through Stockholm
    all the way here to Haparanda.  Officially it ends not on the border itself, but rather
    at a junction with the Northern Lights Road in Tornio, so some 800 meters of Route E4
    belong to Finland.</p>

<p>Interstingly, there's also a rail connection between Haparanda and Tornio.  Finnish
    railways historically use Russian 1520 mm gauge (1524 mm actually but it's close enough),
    while Sweden has 1435 mm railroads common around most of the world.  So there are double
    tracks between Tornio and Haparanda, and the cars need to change their bogies on one of
    the stations.  There is currently no passenger service but there is a connecting
    bus between stations at Luleå in Sweden and Kemi in Finland. 

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5732/21348956244_6644c3ae22_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5732/21348956244_5e34f2825d_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="34" title="Finland-Sweden border in Tornio-Haparanda" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>34. The border itself.  Finnish border guards were doing spot checks on the Finnish side.
    They pulled me over, asked for my papers, and examined the contents of my trunk.
    Surprisingly, the border guard woman spoke very good (though still noticeably accented)
    Russian, much better than the border guards at Russia-Finland border stations with their
    horrible thick accents.  She disappeared with my passport into their van for some fifteen
    minutes or so, and I was getting a little worried (although thankful for being able to 
    have a bit of rest).  Finally she returned and told me that everything was in order,
    and I drove away towards Kemi, Ii, and Oulu.   
</p>

<p>I didn't stop in Tornio or take any pictures of it so the only bit of information I can
    tell is that Lapin Kulta, a very common Finnish beer brand, used to be brewed in Tornio.
    Which makes sense as <i>Lapin Kulta</i> means "Lapland Gold".  Sadly they moved its
    production into Lahti in 2010.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5793/21783850288_4566ab2043_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5793/21783850288_b7a98003c7_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="35" title="Oulu bypass" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>35. Oulu bypass, Road 4.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/752/21350591903_eed849dc07_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/752/21350591903_e940b6c868_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="36" title="Tar Road" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>36. I exited Road 4 at an interchange on the Oulu bypass, and after refuelling
    drove to the southeast on the National Road 22, Oulu-Kajaani.  Most of the Road 22
    is also known as Tervan tie <i>(Finn. Tar Road)</i> tourist route.  The city of Kajaani
    is the center of Kainuu Region, which is a backwater part of Finland which isn't really
    notable for anything in particular, apart from a history of tar-making.  I mean really.
    No offense to the people of Kainuu but "tar-making" sounds like the least exciting occupation
    ever even for me.  Tar, in fact, was a traditional Finnish export.  They still have candies,
    liqueur, and even ice-cream with the taste of tar in Finland.  It was believed to be
    the best medicine for, well, everything (together with alcohol and sauna). </p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5631/21350605883_7a1602178e_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5631/21350605883_08d7889425_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="37" title="Paltamo bridges" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>37. Bridges on Road 22 and a railway line in Paltamo, over the mouth of Kiehmänjoki
    river which flows into Oulujärvi, the largest lake by far in this part of Finland.
    As I expected, traffic on that Tar Road was really light.  And of course it was much
    warmer here than in Lapland, at +10 &deg;C.    
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5647/21945583786_63c26675aa_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5647/21945583786_56609843ee_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="38" title="Vuokatti" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>38. Roads 22 and 6 technically join in Kajaani, but unless you have some business
    in Kajaani itself you should take the Regional Road 899 as a shortcut; it would be
    significantly shorter that way.  Road 899 runs through a town named Vuokatti, which
    has some skiing slopes although of course they are nowhere as great as those in Ylläs.
</p>

<p>National Road 6, or Kuutostie <i>(Finn. Sixth Road)</i> is very long, starting at Koskenkylä
    village near Loviisa where it branches off from Road 7, and running to the northeast
    through Kouvola, Lappeenranta, Imatra and Joensuu.  After Joensuu it curves back to the
    nortwest and runs some more towards Kajaani.  I had driven on Road 6 several times before,
    as it mostly runs along the Russian border; I was familiar from the stretch from Lappeenranta
    to Joensuu.  It turned out that Kajaani-Joensuu part is rather long and has very little 
    traffic as well. </p>
    
<p>After noticing that I had already driven 600 kilometers, I stopped at a rest area in a nice
    pine forest near Road 6, and rested for about half an hour, stretching my legs and eating
    my remaining food.  This time shitty-variety microwavable burgers actually seemed quite
    tasty, even though I had to eat them cold.</p>
    
<p>I was tired of course but felt okay to drive on.  In fact in my original plans I intended to
    make an overnight stop on the return trip somewhere in the middle, but ended up deciding 
    against it.  Kajaani or Iisalmi or Nurmes or whatever just didn't seem attractive enough
    by themselves to justify spending an evening there after Lapland, and I already knew I was
    capable of making the entire trip in one go.</p>    

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5667/21350715443_6a1107cc3b_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5667/21350715443_3ffb04c12d_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="39" title="Joensuu bypass" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>39. Joensuu bypass, a stretch of motorway.  The part from Joensuu to Imatra was already familiar
    to me.  It has moderate traffic but still doesn't compare to Roads 4 and 5.  Cars with 
    Russian license plates finally reappeared here.  Russians often drive annoyingly slowly in Finland (in stark contrast to Russia itself), sometimes at 10&nbsp;km/h less than speed limit
    (even in perfect driving conditions),
    while the Finns themselves tend to speed lightly as is normal everywhere in the world,
    at about +10% to speed limit.  Myself, when in Finland, I do as the Finns do.
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/616/21349122354_d2e00b7e1f_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/616/21349122354_3bebbddc2d_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="40" title="Near Imatra" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>40. Last kilometers until the Russian border near Imatra.  It got dark while I was crossing
    the border.  Up until then I felt a bit sleepy (and even tried unsuccessfully to doze off
    for a while, stopping somewhere near Kitee), but Russian roads woke me up very well.
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/726/21981658021_cff43357a1_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/726/21981658021_c04479770a_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="41" title="1210 km" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>41. And at about 22:00 here I am in St. Petersburg again, after driving for 1210 km.
    That's a record I'm unlikely to surpass any time soon.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/746/21349140064_a3ea7a980d_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/746/21349140064_ec152767d0_c.jpg" width="800" height="532" alt="42" title="3242 km" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>42. And the total distance travelled on this trip was 3242 km (other stats: 73.8 km/h
    average speed, 217.4 l of gas used, 6.7 l/100 km gas mileage).  My eight days long Lapland
    vacation was finally over.
</p>

<h3>Trip Budget</h3>

<p>I usually don't track travel expenses very closely, one of the primary reasons being that
    in a group it's hard to keep a clear picture who pays for what and how much it comes to
    in total.  As I was travelling alone this time, I was able to keep track of all expenses
    nicely.  So here's my budget if you wonder how much a moderately frugal person will
    need for a week-long car trip from St. Petersburg, Russia to Finnish Lapland.</p>

<p>Excluding the souvenirs, the trip cost me about 50,000 rubles, or &euro;725.
    I think that's really cheap for a week-long vacation, especially considering
    our plummeted ruble exchange rate.  Moreover, bringing someone along wouldn't
    have increased the total budget for more than 7,000-10,000 rub.; accomodation
    and gas expenses wouldn't have changed. </p>
    
<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>As you might have noticed, I pretty much fell in love with the North and with Lapland
    in particular.  Out of three landscapes I visited -- Pallas-Yllästunturi fells,
    Scandinavian mountains in Käsivarsi, and Northern Norway fjords -- most of all I liked
    the Scandinavian mountains.  I had never actually been to any real mountains and it turned
    out mountains are even more amazing than fjords.  The cabin in Äkäslompolo also was
    literally perfect.  I would gladly go there again, perhaps even in winter -- maybe I'll
    ever learn to ski for the occasion.  And I want to visit Käsivarsi again badly.
    The hike to Treriksröset made me want to try backpacking; all I ever tried before were
    day hikes, and now I'm intending to buy some basic backpacking gear and try some weekend 
    backpacking in summer 2016.  And as for road trips, Northern Norway would be a worthy
    next destination; I'd like to see Tromsø and the North Cape.</p>

<p>In short -- go to Lapland.  Lapland is great.</p>
