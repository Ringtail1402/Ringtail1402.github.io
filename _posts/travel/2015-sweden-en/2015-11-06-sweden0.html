<p>In the July of 2015, me, my girlfriend Olga, and our friend, whose name is also Olga,
planned a road trip across Sweden.  Sweden was not our first option
(the original idea was Germany), and this was not going to be our first
visit there; in 2014, we made a short but intense road trip to Flåm, Norway
from Finland on a rental car.  This time, I actually had my own car
in a reasonable shape, and so we chose Sweden (with a little bit of Denmark)
as a nice and reachable destination.</p>

<p>In hindsight, our itinerary, which had been pretty much entirely plotted
  by me, was not the best one.  Too much driving and not enough staying
  in one place for a while to enjoy it.  This however was somewhat
  rectified in the second half of our journey.  Overall, we certainly
  saw a lot and enjoyed it very much, and this is a short account of our trip,
  in fourteen parts <i>(and believe me I really tried to make this short!)</i>.</p>
