width="800" height="532" alt="1" title="The Sandero" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>1. So, we all packed our briefcases, and our Sandero, near our apartment block
  in southwestern St. Petersburg, Russia, is ready to go now.</p>

<p>A few words on the Sandero.  My first car, bought in early 2013, was a
  2007 Daewoo Matiz, one of the smallest and allegedly shittiest cars there is.  Now, despite a rather
  sad look, Matiz is actually a fairly decent car, certainly the best you could
  buy for those money.  It is not, however, designed or built with longevity in
  mind, and, having already suffered some failures due to age and wear of various parts
  (e. g. my heater sprung a leak and drained all my radiator fluid right in the cabin),
  I never even tried to take my Matiz abroad.  I have a rather faint idea of what to do if my car
  breaks down abroad, and I'm pretty such that whatever I'm supposed to do in
  this case, it would be very costly.</p>

<p>Having driven some 30,000 km in two years, after some minor crashes I didn't
  even bother to repair the body work after, I sold that Matiz pretty much
  for pocket change, and decided to buy a proper new car.  The Renault Sandero
  (known as Dacia Sandero in most of the world) seemed like nice choice, and,
  well, so far it was.  A cheap and reliable car, modest and unassuming but
  nothing to really complain about.  I actually even think it's kinda pretty.
  (Renault-styled radiator grille definitely suits it; Dacia Sanderos look
  significantly more boring in my opinion.)  I had already driven my new Sandero around
  Finland a bit, and now it was time for a more serious journey.  <i>Spoiler
  warning: Sandero handled the 3300 km-long road trip fine and there was not
  a slightest problem</i>.</p>

<p>So here we go.  Get some breakfast at a local Burger King, get some gas,
  and off we go.</p>

width="800" height="532" alt="2" title="St. Petersburg Ring Motorway" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>2. I live in the southwest of St. Petersburg, and the road to Finland is at
the northwest.  The simplest (though not the shortest) way to is to bypass
St. Petersburg clockwise using its Ring Motorway.  The traffic on its western
portion is light, and you get to drive across the entire Gulf of Finland on
the causeway of Kronstadt Dam.  We're nearing the Tallinn Highway interchange here.
The second main route from St. Petersburg to the EU starts here.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3670/19812162659_6db60a6ae2_o.jpg"

width="800" height="532" alt="3" title="Kronstand Dam" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>3. Driving on top of the Kronstadt Dam ("Safety Facilities Complex" officially). The construction of the dam, meant to shield
St. Petersburg against floods, has started in the 1970s, and completed
only in 2011.  It includes an underwater tunnel under the main waterway,
a drawbridge over the secondary one, and a number of floodgates.  The waterways
are actually shut off only maybe once or twice per year, for a few hours.
The motorway aspect of the dam is a much more obvious and perhaps a more important
one.  Apart from completing the Ring Motorway, it connects the island town of Kronstadt,
a centuries-old Russian naval base, to the mainland.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3794/20004086971_73c530f144_o.jpg"

width="800" height="554" alt="4" title="Primorskoe Highway" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>4. After the dam, we leave Ring Motorway via Primorskoe Highway interchange,
going west.  Primorskoe <i>(Russ. Seaside)</i> Highway is a nice 2+2 urban highway, passing
through the St. Petersburg suburb of Setroretsk <i>(Russ. Sestra River Town)</i>.
Sestroretsk, while lacking estates and palaces which Peterhof and Tsarskoe Selo
are noted for, is a fairly nice and pleasant town, as far as Russian towns go.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3779/19812194149_b97b7f739a_o.jpg"

width="800" height="532" alt="5" title="Scandinavia Route" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>5. After Sestroretsk, the principal road to the town of Vyborg and Finnish border
is the Scandinavia Route.  I thoroughly dislike this road.  Its worst part is a
65 km long 1.5+1.5 section (one lane in each direction, with a huge paved shoulder;
trucks and slow vehicles move over to this shoulder to ease overtaking).  Huge traffic
including trucks to local rock quarries, excellent pavement, and few bends make
for lots of speeding and frantic overtaking.  Fatal accidents are extremely common.
Since 2014, the road is finally being rebuild into a proper motorway, but it will
take ages before the 1.5+1.5 "section of death" will be replaced.</p>

<p>The section closer to Sestroretsk, and the entire section almost from the bypass of
  the city of Vyborg to Finnish border, are regular "honest" 1+1 roads, which are
  at least not as chaotic.  After Vyborg the traffic gets fairly light as well.
  This picture is taken right before the Vyborg bypass, I believe.  Overall,
the distance from Sestroretsk to Finnish border is about 150 km.</p>

<p>The "Scandinavia" title is a misnomer as well, by the way; Finland is not
  a Scandinavian country.  Funnily enough, there is a road which will take
  you from St. Petersburg to Scandinavia proper (the northernmost part of Norway
  to be precise), the Kola Route, some 2000 km long or so.</p>

width="800" height="532" alt="6" title="Torfyanovka Border Crossing" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>6. There are three border crossing points in Lenindgradskaya Oblast
(region of Russia where St. Petersburg is located).  These are Torfyanovka
<i>(Russ. Peat Hamlet)</i>, Brusnitchnoye <i>(Russ. Cowberry Village)</i>, and Svetogorsk
<i>(Russ. Light Ridges)</i>.  The Finnish counterparts of these border points are called
Vaalimaa, Nuijamaa, and Imatra, respectively.  All of them are located relatively close to each other,
look mostly similar, and the queues are about the same.  The main route
St. Petersburg&nbsp;&mdash; Helsinki&nbsp;&mdash; Turku goes through the southernmost Torfyanovka/Vaalimaa
border crossing.  We're waiting in a queue before Torfyanovka here.
The queues used to be significatly worse before; the ongoing Russian economic crisis
made a lot of Russians unable to afford shopping and weekend trips to Finland anymore.</p>

<p>7. Right before the passport checks.  I rather like the dull grey watchtower
to the right.  Somehow it looks very appropriate for Russia.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3832/19378092833_602002ed7a_o.jpg"

width="800" height="532" alt="8" title="National Road 7" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>8. Ah, Finland at last!  Driving in Finland is an order of magnitude calmer
and safer and overall more pleasant than in Russia.  The road between Russian
border and the Finnish capital of Helsinki, bypassing cities of Porvoo, Loviisa,
Kotka, and Hamina, is called Valtatie 7 <i>(Finn. National Road)</i>.  As of 2015,
nearly all of the road 7 (some 200 km long) is a motorway now; the only remaining section is
Hamina-Vaalimaa, about 25 km long.  It will be also rebuilt by 2018.</p>

<p>The landspace also changes dramatically.  The Karelian Isthmus, crossed
  by the Scandinavian Route, used to be a Finnish land until the Winter War
  of 1939-1940.  Most of the Finnish towns and villages still exist, although
  nearly all Finnish place names were changed to rather bland-styled Russian ones.
  However the population is
  sparse, many villages are partially abandonded, and most of the area seems
  to be just one enormous forest, with
  none of the farms and fields so common on the Finnish side; a typical Russian
  landscape, in other words.</p>

<p>Note that this road has two lanes in the direction of the Russian border.
  The second lane is meant for trucks; there used to be truck queues many
  kilometers long, hauling all kinds of cargo mostly from the ports of Kotka and
  Hamina.  These however seem to be a thing of the past, too, not
  only because of the Russian crisis, but also because of the development of
  Russian seaports like Ust'-Luga.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/258/19812392519_7466ae6d50_o.jpg"

width="800" height="532" alt="9" title="National Road 7" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>9. Even non-motorway section of road 7 is a pleasant drive, with fairly light
and calm traffic.  The speed limit is 80 km/h, usually raised to 100 km/h on
strictly rural sections, and lowered to 60 km/h or so in villages.  (50 km/h
in built-up areas.)</p>

<p>The de-facto speed limit in Russia is 110 km/h, 80 km/h in villages and built-up
areas.  Well, officially it's 90 and 60 km/h, but as of now, there is no penalty
for speeding up to +20 km/h, not even a warning.  90/110 km/h speed limit is
virtually never enforced as well.  Overall, Russian roads would profit enormously
from more differentiated speed limits.  The Finns signpost speed limits from
30 km/h to 120 km/h in 10 km/h steps as appropriate for the specific stretch of road, while
Russian all-encompassing 60 km/h and 90 km/h are often a poor fit (well,
40 km/h speed limit sign is also common, but that's it).</p>

width="800" height="532" alt="10" title="Ahvenkoski Bridge" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>10. The motorway stretch of the Valtatie 7.  This is a bridge across
Ahvenkoski <i>(Finn. Perch Rapids)</i>, one of the branches of Kymi river, the
largest river of Southeastern Finland.  A tunnel looms in the distance.
Finland is a flat country, with pretty much no mountains and very few
tunnels, and most of them seem to be on the Turku-Helsinki-Russia route.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/489/19972880736_11886c320d_o.jpg"

width="800" height="532" alt="11" title="Helsinki Ring III" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>11. Helsinki has two beltway roads, the Ring I, and the Ring III.  As for Ring
II, they built a short stretch of it, then apparently decided it was not such
an important road after all.  We're bypassing Helsinki via Ring III.  This is a
fairly nice road, although not built to motorway standards, having some bus stops
and traffic lights.  It seems to be
less congested than Ring I as well.  Some constructions on Ring III interchanges
is ongoing.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3759/20004360971_33af8ca262_o.jpg"

width="800" height="532" alt="12" title="Helsinki Ring III" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>12. Ring III, also signposted as Kantatie 50 <i>(Finn. Primary Road)</i>.
The display shows predicted driving times to the exits to various Valtaties.
We need Valtatie 1, the Helsinki-Turku motorway.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/435/19811107098_544bd8031a_o.jpg"

width="800" height="532" alt="13" title="National Road 1" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>13. The Valtatie 1 is now a motorway along the entire length (about 120 km).
One of its stretches has several tunnels in succession.  We stop at a
huge ABC filling station/restaurant/supermarket at the Lohja exit for dinner,
and continue on.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3770/19811142968_bf5130b422_o.jpg"

width="800" height="532" alt="14" title="Turku" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>14. After a 550 km long drive, Turku at last!  This is our second visit
to Turku, and for the second time, we're here only for a few hours until our
ferry departs.</p>

<p>Turku, known in Swedish as Åbo, is the third city of Finland, after Helsinki
  and Tampere, with population of 180,000 (300,000 metropolitan area).  It was also
  an ancient capital of Finland, back when Finland was just a big Swedish province.
  The capital was moved to Helsinki only in 1812, soon after Russia
  conquered Finland from Sweden.  Turku boasts an ancient bishop seat, a large
  medieval castle, and an oldest university of Finland (well, actually the university
  had been moved to Helsinki, but another one was re-established in Turku).
  It is also an enormously pleasant and cute town.</p>

<p>Turku is located in the very southwest of Finland, in the mouth of Aura river,
  which you can see in this picture.  A huge archipelago of rocky islands and
  islets (skerries) is located just beyond Turku.  It is called the Archipelago
  Sea, and is actually the largest archipelago in the world, counting by the
  number of islands (some 50,000 if you count all of the smallest rocks).  A
  winding waterway through the Archipelage Sea connects Turku harbor with
  Åland Isles, halfway between Finland and Sweden.</p>

width="800" height="532" alt="15" title="Some statue" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>15. We had about two hours to spare, and went on a walk along the Aura river.
We had already seen the center of Turku, with its cathedral and university,
last year, so we went in the opposite direction this time, towards the sea.
No idea who this guy is.</p>

width="800" height="532" alt="16" title="Majland Restaurant Ship" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>16. A great number of all kinds of ships are moored along the river of Aura.
These ships are the main attraction of this parts of the city.  This is for example
the restaurant ship of Majland, originally built in 1856 in Sweden.</p>

<p>17. The most common type of ship is of course small yachts of Turku
citizens.</p>

width="800" height="532" alt="18" title="Apartment block" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>18. I must admit I'm in love with modern Finnish apartment blocks.  There may be not much
unusual about them&nbsp;&mdash; in fact, they are not all that different from Russian ones,
at least from the outside&nbsp;&mdash; but something about the design and the proportions
and the materials and the locations invariably strikes me as just exactly right,
the way things ought to be.  Even Swedish and Danish apartment blocks do not look
that cozy to me.</p>

<p>19. Steamship Ukkopekka <i>(Finn. Old Man Pekka)</i>, constructed in 1938 in Helsinki
as an icebreaking inspection vessel.  Supposedly, it is the last coal-powered
passenger icebreaking steamer in the world.  It offers cruises around the
Archipelago Sea nowadays.</p>

<p>21. More Turku apartment blocks.  These balconies completely covered by
frameless glass panes are a feature I particularly adore.</p>

<p>22. An older clock tower in the distance, probably a church.</p>

width="800" height="532" alt="23" title="Aspö" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>23. M/S Aspö connects Turku with the most remote island of the Archipelago Sea,
named Utö <i>(Swed. Outer Island)</i>.  A really tiny islet, remote, desolate, and stormswept,
less than a kilometer across, with a lighthouse and a small village, population about 40.  Such a great vacation site naturally
has a hotel of its own and a marine connection to Turku.  No, really, I would love
to spend a week or two there some time in future.</p>

<p>24. A classic British Mini.  The Finns love their classic cars.  So do the
Swedes, but Finns go as far as having a special "museum car" kind of license plate.</p>

<p>27. Museum ship Sigyn, a wooden barque built in 1887, named after the wife
of Loki, the Norse god we all know from the Marvel comics and movies.
It is one of the ships of the Forum Marinum, the maritime museum of Turku.</p>

<p>28. We now reached the area of the former Turku shipyards, known as
Wärtsilä Crichton-Vulcan.  The shipyards belonged to Wärtsilä, a huge Finnish
industrual conglomerate, best known for their ship diesel engines; they manufacture
the largest diesel engines in the world, in fact.  Their shipbuilding branch
sadly went bankrupt in 1989, and the shipyards changed hands several times
and belong to Meyer Werft (Germany) now.  The production has been moved
from the Aura banks to the suburb of Perno back in 1983, and the old shipyard,
historically named Crichton-Vulcan, was used only for ship repair, and
eventually shut down in 2004.  The shipyard lay abandoned for some years, and
then most of it was demolished.
A new residential district, named Telakkaranta <i>(Finn. Shipyard Shore)</i>, is now
nearing completion here.  The old cranes were apparently kept as monuments,
and I must say these are the prettiest cranes I ever saw.
 </p>

 <p>Wärtsilä corporation is named after the village where the sawmill
   which eventually grew to became the huge company was originally constructed in 1834.
   Curiously, that village now actually belongs to Russia (and is best known
   as the site of Vyartsilya border crossing in Karelia).  Same with Stora
   Enso paper corporation, literally the oldest known existing corporation in
   the world; named after the town of Enso, which now belongs to Russia and
   is known as Svetogorsk.</p>

<p>29. The actual hooks are replaced with steel icosahedrons.</p>

<p>32. Sorry, I just like these cranes a little bit too much. </p>

<p>33. Construction of an apartment block in Telakkaranta.</p>

<p>34. Suomen Joutsen <i>(Finn. Finnish Swan)</i>, a full rigged sailing ship, also
from the Forum Marinum museum.  Built in 1902 in France under the name Laënnec, it
served as a school ship for Finnish Navy until 1991.</p>

<p>35. Yet another museum ship, the Bore, constructed in 1960 in Sweden.  It is
  both the last steamship built in Scandinavia, and, supposedly, the first
car ferry on Finland-Sweden route (although I seem to recall some other vessel
is mentioned as the first Baltic ferry in the Vellamo marine museum in Kotka).
Also known as Kristina Regina in 1987-2010, when it was used as a cruise ship
by Kotka-based Kristina Cruises company.</p>

<p>36. Beyond Telakkaranta blocks, there is a rocky outcropping, called
Korppolaismäki <i>(Finn. uh... a hill having something to do with crows?)</i>.</p>

<p>37. There seems to be some sort of artificial cave under Korppolaismäki.
I'm totally at a loss what it might be; I was unable to Google anything,
in English at least.  Some old military installation perhaps?  At any rate,
it must be old; the stairs are severely decayed.</p>

<p>38. A huge thick door leads inside.  Sadly I didn't have the time to
explore.  All I saw inside was a small empty room with lots of graffiti,
with exits leading deeper.</p>

<p>40. Passing a short tunnel under Korppolaismäki, we turn back towards our car.
An administrative building on Stålarminkatu street, one of the few if not the only
building left from old Wärtsilä shipyards.</p>

<p>41. Old gas holder.  I like these structures, there are a few in
old St. Petersburg industrial districts as well.  Fuel gas used to be stored in them
back when it was manufactured from coal.  Old gas holders are often
converted for some modern use.  This one is no exception; it now holds a huge
tank of hot water, used as a thermal battery for the central heating network.
There is apparently a small round steel gas holder next to this one, but we
didn't notice it during our walk.</p>

<p>42. These residentials building are probably older than the ones on the Aura
quay, but the location seems to be chosed perfectly.</p>

<p>43. There are more rocky hills and small tunnels closer to the center of Turku.  The one
to the right is occupied by the Urheilupuisto <i>(Finn. Sports Park)</i>.</p>

<p>44. A large stadium named after Paavo Nurmi, a famous Finnish runner
who won a number of Olympic medals in the 1920s.</p>

<p>46. We left our car at a free parking lot on Samppalinnankatu street.
It is a five minute drive from there to the Turku Harbour, where we were
due to board the Viking Grace cruiseferry, for an overnight passage
to Stockholm.  So here we are, waiting in a queue with mostly Swedes
and some Finns and Norwegians and Ålanders and a few cars from other countries
(no Russians in sight anywhere, unlike the previous year).  To be continued!</p>
