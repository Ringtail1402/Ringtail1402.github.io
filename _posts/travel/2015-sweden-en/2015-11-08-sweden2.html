<p>In the first part, we drove from St. Petersburg to Turku (600 km), and after a short
  walk around Turku, got to the Viking Line ferry terminal.</p>

<p>The Baltic Sea boasts an extremely lively system of sea ferries.
  Probably no other sea in the world matches it in that respect.  The main routes
  are Helsinki-Tallinn, Helsinki-Stockholm, and Turku-Stockholm.  There are ferries
  to the Åland Isles, halfway between Finland and Sweden, and Finland-Sweden ferries
  usually make a stop at Åland anyway (this is apparently required for them to operate
  tax-free shops onboard).  There is also a Stockholm-Riga route, some routes
  from Finland to Poland and Germany, Vaasa-Umeå route (Finland-Sweden but
  much farther in the north), St. Petersburg-Helsinki, St. Petersburg-Helsinki-Stockholm-Tallinn,
  and probably some others.  Still, Helsinki-Tallinn and Turku-Stockholm are by far
  the most important ones.</p>

<p>Most ferries on these routes are operated by only two companies, Viking Line
  and Tallink-Silja.  I'm not sure if there is any significant difference; so far
  I only had experience with Viking Line.  The ferries themselves are huge, and
  are properly called cruiseferries.  Apart from basic passage, optionally with any car
  or RV or even a semi truck, they offer cabins, including some luxurious ones,
  bars and restaurants, tax-free shops (mostly with cosmetics and jewelry), spas,
  nightclubs, and so on.  In fact you can actually just book a round trip cruise, without
  actually setting a foot down at your destination, just so you can drink twice
  as much.  Yes people actually do that, largely because of cheap booze.  There is even a stereotype of "drunken
  Finns falling asleep right in the corridors" although I didn't actually witness
  anything to that degree.</p>

<p>Even if you actually just want to drive from Finland to Sweden, the ferry is
  the only reasonable option.  You could drive all the way around the Baltic Sea
  up north, of course.  That would be 1800 km from Turku to Stockholm. That's two
  days of driving, and the gas alone would cost you more than a ferry ticket.
  The scenery would not be particularly exciting as well, not on the Finnish side
  at least.</p>

<p>So, we were interested in an overnight passage from Turku to Stockholm
  (and back, eight days later), for three people with a regular-sized car.
  This cost us &euro;495, with a return trip.  This included breakfasts,
  both for direct and return
  trip, and a dinner in all-you-can-eat buffet, for direct trip only (although
  we ended up buying it on the return trip anyway).  It would have been &euro;342
  without any meals.  Could have been even cheaper if we picked a cabin without
  a window for the direct trip.  By the time you get to your cabin you're
  generally too drunk to enjoy the scenery anyway.  The price seems reasonable
  enough.  In fact most of long-distance ferries on other routes I considered
  for possible travels seem to cost significantly more.</p>

<p>1. We booked and paid our passage two weeks in advance, although in theory
you can buy a ticket right at the registration booth before departure.  The Viking Line terminal
in Turku is located right by the old castle (which I still haven't visited
as of now).  The directions to "Satama" <i>(Finn. Harbor)</i> and "Viking Line"
are posted on regular street signs around Turku, although using a navigator
is still recommended.  Upon getting there&nbsp;&mdash; the ticket suggests an hour in advance,
although in practice half an hour will likely be fine as well&nbsp;&mdash; you present
your booking printout to a girl in a registration booth, get your keycards
for the cabin, cards for meals (if any), and a paper you have to put on your
rear view mirror.  Then you get directed to one of the queues.  Then there's some wait.</p>

<p>As you can see, the huge ramps in the back are used by semi trucks and other
  larger vehicles.  (As far as I understand there are also Ro-Ro ships specifically
  built for semis on this route, but cruiseferries also accept semis.)  To the
  right you can see the terminal building with boarding bridges for car-less travellers, not unlike what you can see in an
  airport.  And then in between there's a rather tiny hole with a long ramp for cars.</p>

<p>By the way, there was an accident in 1994, on an Estonian ferry appropriately
  named <i>Estonia</i>, when those ramps in the back basically opened up by themselves at sea during a storm, and the
  ship filled up with water and sunk.  853 of 989 people aboard died, making
  this the deadliest peacetime shipwreck in European history.  Since then of course
  they made huge safety improvements.  Like making sure rear ramps do not open up
  at sea.</p>

<p>2. After an hour or so in this queue, it is finally our turn.</p>

width="800" height="532" alt="3" title="Boarding a ferry" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>3. It's steep!</p>

<p><a href="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3810/19813848889_5a2680e90f_o.jpg"
target="_blank"><img

width="800" height="532" alt="4" title="Boarding a ferry" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>4. Almost there...</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/341/20000564405_82b381d908_o.jpg"
target="_blank"><img

width="800" height="532" alt="5" title="Car deck" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>5. Boarding the car deck.  The ferry personnel show you where you're supposed
to pull up.  Overall boarding a ferry is very simple (which in my case means
 "you don't need to talk to anyone"), although I can't help wondering
what happens if you bump into anyone and block everyone behind you.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/357/19379604063_69a579d725_o.jpg"
target="_blank"><img
src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/357/19379604063_9cfbbc31c9_c.jpg"
width="800" height="532" alt="6" title="Car deck" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>6. The cars have to be packed very tightly, leaving 20 cm or so between them.
You'd better remember where you left your car; the car deck is large and fairly
featureless.  It also gets locked soon after departure, so take all the stuff
you need from the car.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/377/20000590805_dcb1eba58f_o.jpg"
target="_blank"><img

width="800" height="532" alt="7" title="Cabin" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>7. A short elevator ride, and here's our cabin!  Deck 7 or 8, I don't remember
  exactly.  With a window, as advertised.
When I first travelled on a Viking Line ferry (a year earlier), I expected something
like a Russian train compartment.  It's actually much better than that, with
spacious enough beds, air conditioning, and your own toilet and a shower.  I saw
worse hotels, anyway.  There's working Wi-Fi
and a TV which greets you by your name and can show you various information about
the ship, although its most interesting feature, live map, didn't work.  The
cheaper kind of cabin doesn't differ in any way, except that there's a picture
instead of a window.  There are more expensive cabins as well.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/459/19814085819_1a5a72eab1_o.jpg"

width="800" height="532" alt="8" title="Sun deck" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>8. The ferry departs at 20:55 and arrives at 7:30 (6:30 Swedish time,
  it's a different time zone from Finland).  That's not a lot, really.  So the plans
are: watch the departure from the sun deck, dinner at all-you-can-eat buffet,
sleep, breakfast, and disembark.  So the first thing we did after leaving
our stuff at the cabin is climbing to the sun deck.  This is the part of the ship
where you can actually walk "outside" and get perfect views in any direction.</p>

<p>Our ferry is called <i>Viking Grace</i>, and it is actually the most modern ferry
  in Viking Line fleet, built in 2013.  It was constructed in the (new) Turku
  shipyards, and has Wärtsilä engines, so I guess Finns and especially Turku
  citizens get patriotic as hell onboard.  For the return trip we had <i>Amorella</i>,
  a much older ship, built in 1988 in Croatia.  It's not really much worse than
  <i>Viking Grace</i>, although its planning leaves something to be desired
  (cheap cabins are on the second-lowest deck, below the waterline, and right by the engine room),
  and the interiors show some wear.</p>

<p>9. Watching departure from the aft part of the sun deck.  The buildings
visible in the distance to the right are Telakkaranta neighborhood under
construction, seen in the previous part.</p>

<p>10. All the waiting lines are empty by now.  To the right is a disembark ramp.</p>

width="800" height="532" alt="11" title="Passenger terminal" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>11. The terminal building.  Used only by car-less travellers, so I have no idea
what it looks like from the inside. </p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/381/19812854818_137d682b22_o.jpg"

width="800" height="532" alt="12" title="Turku castle" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>12. The Åbo Castle is clearly visible to the left.  It is one of the oldest
building in Finland, dating back to 1280.  And if you look closely, you can also
notice a row of railway catenary poles below; there is a passenger railway station next to the
terminal building.</p>

<p>13. The boarding bridges are withdrawn now, and we're sailing away in a couple
of seconds.</p>

<p>14. Here we go!</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/377/19814484199_d96c3780cb_o.jpg"
target="_blank"><img

width="800" height="532" alt="15" title="Pilot boat" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>15. From the starboard side, you can enjoy views of other parts of Turku
seaport, like this pier where a pilot boat is moored.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/511/19813100978_15f1d58749_o.jpg"

width="800" height="532" alt="16" title="Turku seaport" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>16. Tallink-Silja ferry terminal is in the middle.  No Silja ferries are
present at the moment.  To the left is a cargo area of the seaport.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/483/19814531209_d7ba7b0b02_o.jpg"

width="800" height="532" alt="17" title="Hirvensalo Island" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>17. And from the port side, the island of Hirvensalo <i>(Finn. Moose Thicket)</i>
  stretches for several kilometers along the waterway.  Hirvensalo and Ruissalo
are two islands of the Archipelago Sea closest to Turku, essentially its suburbs.
The islands in the vicinity of Turku are connected to the mainland with bridges,
but farther out, there are only small road ferries.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/529/19814610579_5f30a30c5e_o.jpg"

width="800" height="532" alt="18" title="Hirvensalo Island" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>18. Hirvensalo shore is full of gorgeous houses and cottages.  This must be
a very expensive place to buy a house in, I imagine.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3761/19378700204_9fbd89ca24_o.jpg"

width="800" height="532" alt="19" title="Archipelago Sea" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>19. The islands soon withdraw farther, and you get to enjoy evening views
of the Archipelago Sea, with its skerries and lighthouses.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/262/19814719059_d1030f6a39_o.jpg"

<p>20. More of the Archipelago Sea.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/535/19813438200_52b8bd7dc4_o.jpg"

width="800" height="532" alt="21" title="Dinner" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>21. The previous two pictures were actually taken right from a window
  of the Aurora all-you-can-eat buffet.  Located at the bow of one of the
  higher decks, it fully justifies its price (&euro;30).  Well sadly I'm not
  very interested in food, so there are no food pictures and I can't even remember
what kind of food they offered.  Well there were meatballs and watermelon.  And unlimited
beer and wine!  That's the coolest part, and possibly the reason why I poorly
remember the food.  (Seriously though, you shouldn't overindulge in drinks
if you're going to drive in the morning.  On the return trip, Finnish police
stopped and tested for alcohol drivers of every single car leaving the ferry;
wouldn't be surprised if the Swedish occasionally do that too.)</p>

<p>22. One more peek from the sun deck after dinner.</p>

<p>24. View from the stern.  We almost left the Archipelago Sea.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/311/19814818839_1a17a04948_o.jpg"

<p>25. Well...  Time to go to bed.  At 1:00, the ferry briefly visits the port
of Långnäs at the Åland Isles.  Långnäs is pretty much a single pier at the middle
of nowhere, apparently built solely so that the ferries could stop at Åland
as briefly as possible.  Few people actually board or disembark here, but stopping
at Åland is legally required if the ferry wants to operate a tax-free shop.
I'm not sure on the details.  Anyway, I wouldn't mind if the trip was a little bit
longer; there is really not enough time for sleep.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/361/19813526310_22dbb1cdd4_o.jpg"

width="800" height="532" alt="26" title="Breakfast" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>26. And so here we are at the same Aurora buffet in the morning, sleepy
and slightly hungover.  Pancakes, watermelon, juice, and milk for us.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/383/19380565323_ae87595c99_o.jpg"

width="800" height="532" alt="27" title="Stockholm suburbs" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>27. Stockholm is located on the shores and islands of a channel connecting
the lake of Mälaren to the Baltic Sea.  The channel is surrounded by a huge
skerry archipelago, just like Turku is (still smaller than the Archipelago Sea,
though).  We are packing our stuff, and the ferry already passes some Stockholm suburbs.
</p>

width="800" height="532" alt="28" title="Car deck" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>28. Ready to go!  Again, I wonder what happens if someone does not show up
for the disembark in time.  The cars are packed so tightly that others might not be
able to maneuver around a car blocking the way.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3742/19975358456_34e7eb676b_o.jpg"

width="800" height="532" alt="29" title="Ferry terminal" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>29. And we're leaving the same way we arrived.  Viking Line ferries dock at
the Stadsgården terminal, fairly close to the city center.  The terminal is a bit
cramped and you won't get an opportunity to stop before it spews you right into
a busy street (where you are not allowed to stop either).  So if you need to set
a destination on your navigator or something like that, you really should do it
before leaving the ferry.</p>

<p>We were planning to spend a good part of a day in Stockholm (it would be our
  second time there), and to leave in the evening, stopping at a motel halfway
  to the island of Öland.  Stockholm would be the subject of the next part, so stay tuned.</p>
