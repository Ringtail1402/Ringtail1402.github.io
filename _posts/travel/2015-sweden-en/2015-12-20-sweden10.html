<p>During the last year or two, I have gradually come to realize I'm not really
  a big fan of visiting big cities.  Note that it is specifically <i>visiting</i>
  that I dislike; I'm perfectly fine with big cities in general.  After all,
  I happen to live in one.  It's just that it feels like a day or two, or a week,
  or even a month cannot really do justice to a city like Stockholm or Copenhagen.
  And too brief an impression can be worse than none, leaving you unsatisfied.</p>
  
<p>Nonetheless, Copenhagen was the one new big city we visited in this trip, and 
  I must say it was pretty good.  It's nearly as good as Stockholm, and
  Stockholm only wins because it feels "more Scandinavian" and has cool
  location on the archipelago.  Copenhagen's layout is more like St. Petersburg,
  flat with a single big waterway, many minor channels, and no real seafront.</p>
  
<p>We woke up in our hotel named <i>Cabinn Scandinavia</i> in the part of city
named Frederiksberg, a quiet old neighborhood to the west from the city center,
technically considered a separate municipality from the rest of 
Copenhagen.  After we got up and stuff, we just walked in the direction of the center.</p>
  
<p>I won't write a Copenhagen history essay here.  A 
   merchant and fishing town existed here since 11th century; the name literally means "Merchant Harbor".
   Absalon, Bishop of Roskilde and a great figure in early Danish history built
   the first castle in what would become Copenhagen in 1186.  Roskilde was Denmark's 
   old capital, and it was only in 1416 when Eric of Pomerania
   moved the capital of Denmark (and of Kalmar Union) here.  In the coming centuries it suffered
   plagues, fires, sieges, and a Nazi occupation, but, well, here it is, beautiful
   and prosperous, population 580,000 Copenhagen proper, and about 2 million metropolitan area
   (35% of entire Denmark population).</p>

<p>1. Vodroffsvej Street, where our hotel was located.  Apparently named after
  some Vodroff who used to be a mechant from Russian origins or something.

<p>2. Huge bike tracks and rare and tightly packed parking spots are immediately noticeable.
  In fact I don't think I saw any open parking lots at all in Copenhagen, just curb 
  parking. 
</p>

width="800" height="532" alt="4" title="Sankt Jørgens Sø" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>4. Central and western parts of Copenhagen are separated by a row of
  rectangular lakes, created in the 16th century or so for protection and as
  city water reservoirs.  This one is called Sankt Jørgens Sø <i>(Dan. St. George Lake)</i>.
</p>

<p>5. This is the first time I saw a gas station directly embedded into
  the first floor of an office building.  Seems a bit dangerous.
</p>

width="800" height="532" alt="6" title="Railways" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>6. Railways going to Copenhagen Central Station go right through the middle
  of the city, but they mostly run in tunnels or excavations and do not affect
  city planning that much.
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5618/20187084821_9c32a00866_o.jpg"

width="800" height="532" alt="7" title="Railways" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>7. The traffic is extremely high.  You can barely take a picture without
  at least one train passing through.
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3816/19558823094_b572fa93a2_o.jpg"

width="800" height="532" alt="8" title="Railways" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>8. The trains also all look very different from each other, different
  models and different ages.
</p>

width="800" height="532" alt="9" title="Wallmans Circus" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>9. Wallmans Circus Building, a concert hall.  We found a restaurant across the road
  and had our breakfast there.
</p>

width="800" height="532" alt="10" title="H. C. Andersen Boulevard" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>10. The widest street in central Copenhagen is named H. C. Andersen Boulevard.
  Andersen and his depressing children books are probably the best known Danish
  thing in the world, apart from Lego (which is also pretty big; I actually saw an unusually high
  proportion of toy stores there, each of them stocking a lot of Lego of course).
</p>

width="532" height="800" alt="11" title="Rådhuspladsen" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>11. Rådhuspladsen, the City Hall Square.  Features the City Hall itself
  (to the right) and a fountain with an odd sculpture depicting a bull fighting
  a fairly small dragon.
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/310/19993641130_77128192cf_o.jpg"

<p>12. The City Hall. </p>

width="800" height="532" alt="13" title="Palace Hotel" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>13. Another cool building on the City Hall Square is the Palace Hotel.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/467/20173556542_297fa0a2c7_o.jpg"

width="800" height="532" alt="14" title="Strøget" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>14. Strøget, a very long pedestrian shopping street, starts from the
  City Hall Square.  Looks pretty much like any old pedestrian shopping
  street ever.
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/488/20187331781_c723eceac2_o.jpg"
target="_blank"><img

width="800" height="532" alt="15" title="Gammel Torv" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>15. Gammel Torv <i>(Dan. Old Square)</i>, pictured, and Nytorv <i>(Dan. New Square)</i>
on the opposite side of Strøget form one big pedestrian square.  Gammel Torv has the oldest
fountain in Copenhagen, the Caritas Well, dating from 1608.
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/400/20187404241_29e1dffa74_o.jpg"

width="800" height="532" alt="16" title="Nytorv" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>16. Nytorv used to be a place of several old city halls.  The last city hall building
  (not pictured) still stands and is used as a courthouse.  The city's scaffold and pillory
  also were located at Nytorv; the last public execution (by beheading) took place
  in 1758, and the last punishment at the pillory took place in 1780.  Mind you,
  Denmark had capital punishment until 1930, and temporarily reinstated it in 1945-1950
  specifically for Nazi criminals. 
</p>

width="800" height="532" alt="17" title="Rådhusstræde" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>17. Rådhusstræde, a typical quiet non-pedestrian street. </p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/512/20187432941_4c03cf7f61_o.jpg"
target="_blank"><img

<p>18. Magstræde street.</p>

width="800" height="532" alt="19" title="Frederiksholms Kanal" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>19. One thing Copenhagen has in common with St. Petersburg is a system
  of old artificial channels in its center, with stone embankments and numerous
  small and often beautiful bridges.  They make Copenhagen and St. Petersburg
  waterways look absolutely unlike Stockholm or Helsinki, which are built on
  archipelagos of numerous rocky islands, and have more natural waterfronts
  and a much higher area taken by water overall.  We're now looking at Frederiksholms Channel,
  which continues to the right after Stormsbroen bridge as Slotsholmen Channel.
  Together they separate Slotsholmen Island from the mainland.  <i>Slotsholmen</i>
  means Castle Island, and this is where Absalon's Castle, then Copenhagen Castle, and then three incarnations
  of Christiansborg Palace where located.  Only the third Christiansborg survives
  to this day.
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/265/19993841100_67b3a6bdd1_o.jpg"

width="800" height="532" alt="20" title="Slotsholmen Kanal" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>20. Slotsholmen Channel and Stormbroen Bridge.  Named after the Swedish
  assault on Copenhagen of 1659; the Swedes stormed pretty much this exact spot
  and were successfully repelled.  The current bridge was built in 1915. </p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/545/20187544261_7bc25a6bed_o.jpg"
target="_blank"><img

width="800" height="532" alt="21" title="Christiansborg Palace" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>21. And this is the third Christiansborg Palace itself, one of the biggest
  landmarks of Copenhagen.  Finished in 1928, much later than you'd expect.
  It just seems Copenhagen had a habit of burning down every so often (which
  is why unlike Stockholm it has no super-medieval-old houses), and
  the second Christiansborg was destroyed by fire in 1884.  The first and the original Christiansborg 
  used to be a royal palace, but after it burned down as well
  in 1794, the royal family moved to Amalienborg Palace, which used to belong
  to some rich nobles, and by the time the second Christiansborg was
  finished, they kind of got used to Amalienborg already.  The current
  Christiansborg houses the Parlament, the Supreme Court, and the Prime Minister's
  Office of Denmark.  Thus being the only known instance in the world of the same building
  housing all three branches of goverment.</p>

width="800" height="532" alt="22" title="Christian IX statue" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>22. The person in front of the palace is King Christian IX, who ruled in 1863-1906
  and was by all accounts a really swell guy.
</p>

width="800" height="532" alt="24" title="Christiansborg Palace" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>24. Some sort of memorial under the arch of Christiansborg.  </p>

<p><a href="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3701/19994037498_ee7ef7564b_o.jpg"

width="800" height="532" alt="25" title="Frederik VII statue" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>25. Another equestrian statue in the back of Christiansborg belongs to
  King Frederik VII, who ruled in 1848-1863 and signed the first constitution
  of Denmark in 1849.  (Technically Denmark had a constitution since the 17th century,
  but that was a constitution than explicitly authorized absolute monarchy,
  which is a pretty unusual thing.) 
  Apparently also a really nice guy, he doesn't really
  deserve having these trash bins put right next to him. </p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/271/20173996772_cd0496b6b4_o.jpg"

width="800" height="532" alt="26" title="Frederisholms Kanal" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>26. Frederiksholms Channel beyond Christiansborg.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/396/19995525209_568e1669e2_o.jpg"

width="800" height="532" alt="27" title="Tour boat" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>27. And just like St. Petersburg, Copenhagen has lots of boats offering tours
  along its channels.  After some deliberation, we bought a ticket for one of these,
  and were not disappointed in the least.  The tour guide explains stuff
  in several languages including English of course, but it was pretty hard to hear
  in the back of the boat over the sound of its engines.  
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3783/20174081732_e0e4f971bf_o.jpg"

width="800" height="532" alt="28" title="Holmen Bro" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>28. The tour starts from Frederiksholms Channel, and the first bridge we pass
  is Holmens Bro, which literally means Island Bridge. </p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/503/20155971856_49267f81cc_o.jpg"
target="_blank"><img

width="800" height="532" alt="29" title="Church of Holmen" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>29. Passing the cross-shaped Church of Holmen.  This part of the city, named
  just Holmen <i>(Island)</i>, indeed used to be an island originally, but it's 
  now connected to the mainland.  Holmen used to hold old shipyards, and the Church 
  of Holmen is a naval church, with graves of Danish naval heroes and so on.
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/356/19995608179_2b7685fb9f_o.jpg"

width="800" height="532" alt="30" title="Børsen" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>30. Across the Church of Holmen is a very recognizable long building,
  with a very tall spire in the shape of four intertwined dragon tails.
  This is the Børsen, or the Royal Stock Exchange.  Built in 1640, it still
  holds the Danish Chamber of Commerce.  
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/477/19995619349_eaf6100aa6_o.jpg"

width="800" height="532" alt="31" title="Main channel" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>31. Leaving the Frederiksholms Channel for the biggest channel of Copenhagen.
  Copenhagen (again like St. Petersburg) is bisected by a huge waterway.
  In Copenhagen's case it is a strait separating islands of Amager and Zealand.
  Most of old Copenhagen is on Zealand (to the left), and this is what we've called "the mainland"
  before, as it's farly large, about 100 km across; Roskilde, Helsingör, and 
  other towns occupy its more distant parts.  Amager (to the right) isn't that small as well,
  being 10 km across, and holding Copenhagen Airport, named Kastrup, and a lot
  of the new developments of Copenhagen.  The part of Amager just across the old city
  is called Christianshavn.  Most of it is pretty nice, but it also holds the
  infamous Christiania, a neighborhood of hippies and junkies.  (Christiania was once
  of the destinations we ended up missing.)
</p>

<p>Oddly enough, this big strait, as wide as our Neva, doesn't seem to have any particular name at all,
  or at least I couldn't find it in Wikipedia and the like.  So henceforth I'll call "the main channel".</p>

  building.

<p>35. If you think St. Petersburg has too few bridges across Neva, you haven't been
  to Copenhagen.  There are only two bridges across the main channel, plus two
  pedestrian/bike bridges, plus a large bridge in the distance, carrying the huge E20 motorway which continues
  on to &Oslash;resund bridge.  A new bridge in central Copenhagen, called
  Inderhavenen Bridge <i>(Dan. Inner Harbor)</i>, is under construction, expected to be opened in February 2016.
  It will be yet another pedestrian/bike bridge though.  To have a car in Copenhagen
  means to suffer, apparently.

<p>36. Royal Danish Playhouse, one of two new theater building at the waterfront.
  Both of them look like something from a late Soviet-era. 
  This one is used for dramatic theater.

<p>38. Leaving the main channel for a while and entering one of the channels
  of Holmen, the northern part of Christianshavn (and apparently a completely different Holmen
  from the one across Christiansborg with a cross-shaped church).  Formerly a naval base,
  most of it has been now converted into a very affluent-looking neighborhood.

<p>39. The most striking building there is Torpedohallen, a torpedo boat
  construction hangar which has also been converted into a residential building.
  If you wonder <a href="http://www.dac.dk/en/dac-life/copenhagen-x-gallery/cases/torpedohallen/" target="_blank">this</a>
  page says that a four-room apartment here cost 4,450,000 Danish krones in 2005,
  which translated to about &euro;600,000.  (Forgot to mention, Denmark has its
  own currency too; a Danish krone <i>(DKK)</i> is worth about 25% more than a 
  Swedish krona <i>(SEK)</i>.)

<p>41. Copenhagen has a small system of water buses linking the main channel shores.
  Painted in distictive ferry-yellow color, these are called Copenhagen Harbor Buses.
  Like Stockholm's Djurgården ferries, they are integrated into city public transit
  system, sharing tickets and fares.  </p>

<p>42.  Entering the main channel yet again. Nyholm, the northernmost part of Holmen, is still used as
  a naval base, at least formally.  Only a few ships are moored there, the most prominent
  being HDMS <i>Peder Skram</i>, a frigate commissioned in 1966 and turned into a museum ship now.
  Mind you, Denmark actually takes its navy (and military in general) fairly seriously, and
  is an active member of NATO. </p>

near Amaliehavn park.</p>

<p>44. Sixtus Battery <i>(Batteriet Sixtus)</i> is a prominent feature of the northern
shore of Nyholm, a row of cannons on a levee.   </p>

<p>45. Another cruise sailing ship, this one named <i>Wind Surf</i>, modern (1990)
and huge.  It looks pretty ugly to me, as if these masts are purely a cosmetic
afterthought.  It actually can raise sails alright, although its main propulsion
system is diesel. </p>

<p>46. The northernmost point of this tour.  All these crowds are gathered here
  to gawk at the (supposedly) main sight in Copenhagen.  We'll have a closer look ourselves 
  in the next part, so, to be continued.</p>
