<p>Lysekil is another small sea town in Bohuslän, much larger than Smögen (pop. 7,600),
  but still pretty tiny.  It is located in about 50 km from Smögen, so we chose it as our
  destination for the next day.  Turned out it is pretty similar to Smögen anyway.</p>

<p>Our second night at Smögen Camping was not as peaceful as the first one.  
  First, some young guys sat around with beer and a boombox pretty much right by our window.
  They actually turned out to be pretty nice.  At 10 pm sharp they got up, collected all their trash,
  and some of them went to bed while others drove away in a taxi with "Gothenburg" written on it.
  That's a long drive from Gothenburg, mind you.  Thus, our opinion of Swedish youth improved a lot, but then
  in the middle of the night a few drunk girls barged into our block, and kept making a lot of noise,
  talking and showering, for quite some time.  Anyway we still had a nice enough sleep.</p>

<p>1. First things first, we drove to Smögen and got some breakfast at the same
  Ekelöfs restaurant.  Parking in entire Smögen is pretty much limited to two parking lots,
  so they have parking meters.  The charge is very cheap though.</p>
  
<p> Generally, it seems that
  parking in the center of even small Swedish towns is always tolled, while Finnish towns
  with population of less than 20,000 or so just limit parking time (requiring a parking clock).
  Parking clock is still occasionally used in Sweden but it's much less common.  Of course it might be
  that I just happened to pick towns with tolled parking in Sweden, and others are different.
  </p>
  
<p>Most parking meters around Sweden seems to be of unified design, easy to use even without knowing Swedish.
  Just stick your bank card in, push some time buttons until the display shows desired
  departure time and toll, and push the big green button.  A big annoyance though is that
  they are often out of order.  In fact after our uneventful trip to Lysekil, we drove to
  a public parking lot (one that my navigator program knew), and found that one of its
  parking meters didn't work at all, and another ate my bank card, then seemed to lock up,
  and returned it only after a few minutes or so, costing me some nerve cells.  Logically
  if parking meters don't work, the parking should revert to free use, but I drove to another
  parking lot on the opposite side of (admittedly tiny) town just to be on the safe side.</p>

<p>2. Okay, excuse me this parking digression.  So here's Lysekil.  It is located on a
  tip of a quite long and thin peninsula.  You can walk from its western to its eastern
  shore in fifteen minutes or so.  This is the western shore, facing the sea.
  Not a lot of people here.

<p>6. Lysekil, unlike Smögen, has a few streets of actual apartment buildings. 
  Ground floor is occupied by various family businesses.  Hairdresser Nils Nilsson,
  Dentist Anders Andersson, Lawyer Erik Eriksson.  It's very cute; it feels like
  they are all one big family here and know each other (which they probably do).  
</p>

<p>7. Unlike Smögen, Lysekil's economy is based on more than just tourism and fishing.
  In particular, it has the largest oil refinery in Sweden, just outside the city.
  We never actually saw it and we would have never guessed that such an idyllic
  location has an enterprise traditonally associated with severe pollution.
  There is even an old railway line connecting Lysekil with the rest of Sweden's 
  rail network, but it seems to have fallen into disuse.    </p>

<p>13. Lysekil is where we decided to try to fish for some crabs.  There are lots
  of small crabs in cracks and seaweeds near the coast.  Crabs eat virtually
  anything (I think), so we took a few shrimps from our breakfast at Ekelöfs in Smögen
  to use as bait.  Our first attempts were not very successful.  We chose a place
  with a significant surf, and tied a shrimp to the end of a long slippery seaweed.
  When we threw it into the water, some crabs did appear in a minute or two, but
  the shrimp slipped out right then.  It sank among the seaweeds, and eventually
  some bits and pieces of shrimp, presumably eaten by someone, drifted away.  We tied
  the next shrimp more securely, and had more success.  Still, crabs slipped away
  very easily in surf when we tried to drag them from the water.  We did manage to pull out one,
  but it fell down on a wet rock and scurried away with surprising speed.

<p>18. Eventually we relocated to a quiet place by a pier.  Someone has already left
  a clothespin tied to a piece of rope there, which made securing the bait much simpler.
  We were easily able to pull out a few crabs.  If you hold them by the sides of their
  very hard carapace, they can't reach you with their claws (or do anything at all).
</p>

<p>19. We released all of them again of course.  It's not as if you can bring home
  a pet crab from Sweden.  When the shrimp got severely disintegrated, we threw its
  remains into the water and watched a larger crab catch it, fight away
  a few hungry fishes, then disappear into seaweeds. </p>

<p>21. The major attractions of Lysekil are its sea life museum and boat tours
  (where you can supposedly see seals), but we didn't have enough money for
  that either (a common theme towards the end of our trip), so we just went for
  a walk on the coast, on the tip of the Lysekil peninsula.   </p>

width="800" height="532" alt="30" title="Gullmarn ferry" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>30. We chose a different route for our trip back to Smögen Camping,
  via Road 161 and Gullmarsfjorden ferry.  Gullmarsfjorden (Gullmarn) is a deep gulf 
  to the east of Lysekil.  It is claimed to be the only genuine fjord
  in Sweden.  Of course it looks nothing like Norway fjords, lacking
  mountains rising right from the water, but it's still pretty long, narrow, and deep.  
  And it has a road ferry crossing over it.</p>

<p>Road ferries are occasionally found on the less important roads of Finland
  and Sweden.  Both countries have about 50 of such ferry lines each, I believe.
  There used to be more of them, but now it's usually more economical to just
  build a bridge than bother with ferries.  Ferries are still used on some lakes,
  straits, and to get to various smaller islands.</p>
  
<p>Road ferries have very little in common with huge Viking Line or Tallink-Silja ships.
  They usually look like a floating platform, with a bridge elevated over car deck on thin
  pillars.  Their capacity may range from a few cars to about a hundred or so.  Using
  a road ferry is trivial: drive to the waiting area, wait for a ferry to come if it's
  not already present (there is a "Call Ferry" button just in case), roll on, wait for a 
  ferry to cross the water body, roll off, drive away.  The crossing is usually short enough
  (a few minutes) that you don't need to leave your car, and ferries don't have any
  passenger facilities, usually not even a toilet.  No interaction with any personnel
  is required either.  All ferries which are considered a part of road network are
  completely free to use both in Finland and Sweden.  (There may be some exceptions.  
  A notable one is Finnish ferries to Åland Islands.  Ferries hopping between Archipelago Sea islands
  are free, but try to go a bit westwards and you need to get a ticket.)</p>
  
<p>Some ferry crossings leave you wondering why does the state even bother to 
  finance this ferry, due to either very low traffic, or easily available detour.
  Gullmarfjord ferry crossing is actually the second largest in Sweden by traffic volume,
  but it would be absolutely trivial to just drive around the fjord.  The detour would be 
  only 25 km or so.  It could be actually faster than waiting for a ferry.</p>
  
<p>I don't know much about road ferries in countries other than Finland and Sweden, and
  I wonder how common they are elsewhere.  Norway definitely has even more ferries, 
  due to its cruel and unusual geography.  Norway ferries are never free though. (In fact even bridges
  and tunnels in Norway are often tolled as well.)  Russia usually doesn't bother to make
  any kind of crossing at all unless absolutely necessary.  There is the infamous Crimea
  ferry of course, and I think you have to use a ferry to get to Yakutsk (the coldest city
  in Siberia) from the rest of the road network.  In our region there is a small and dilapidated ferry crossing
  in the town of Voznesenye.  I know of at least two former ferry crossings on the Karelian Isthmus,
  but these were shut down long ago.</p>

<p>31. Speaking about Sweden and Finland again, some ferries operate on demand, but 
  larger ones have schedules.  Gullmarn ferries depart once every 20 minutes,
  in daytime at least.  The actual ships are named <i>Gullbritt</i> (built in 1995,
  Alexandria, Egypt, yeah that seems pretty far) and <i>Saturnus</i> (built in 2014,
  Uusikaupunki, Finland).  We ended up crossing on <i>Gullbritt</i>.

<p>32. Here it is, unloading cars.  The crossing is quite busy as it's the shortest
  way to get to Lysekil from pretty much anywhere but Smögen or Norway.  Still, no one
  would die if they had to drive just 25 km more.

<p>33. Crossing in progress.   The woman on the right actually walked on board of the
  ferry on foot.  A car dropped her off on the Lysekil side, and she stayed at a bus stop after
  crossing.

<p>35. Passing <i>Saturnus</i>.  Gullmarsfjorden doesn't look particularly
exciting for a place named "fjord".</p>

<p>36. About to roll off.  Gullmarn ferry was a big detour for us, but then,
  we got to use a road ferry for the first time ever (I didn't have any experience
  with Finnish road ferries at the moment.)  We ate in Smögen again and drove to camping.
</p>

<p>After our third and the last night at the camping, we were supposed to cross Sweden
  once again to the city of Uppsala, the final point of our expedition.  After Uppsala
  the only things left to do were to go to Stockholm, to take a ferry back to Finland,
  and to drive all the way back to St. Petersburg.  To be continued.</p>
