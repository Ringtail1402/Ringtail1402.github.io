<p>This is the last part of the series about our Swedish journey, but
  we actually had three days remaining till the end of our vacation.  This wasn't 
  really a lot though.  Driving from Smögen Camping to Uppsala (475 km) took up most of the
  first of these three days in particular.

<p>1. Here we go again.  Our route was: E6&nbsp;&mdash; Road 44&nbsp;&mdash; E20&nbsp;&mdash;
  E18&nbsp;&mdash; Road 55.  Major cities passed were Trollhättan, Örebro, and Västerås.
  (The latter is pronounced a lot like "Westeros".)
</p>

<p>2. Rest area near Road 44 in Grästorp Municipality.  Sweden has absolutely
  amazing rest areas.  Finland and Norway do not even come close.  Rest areas
  virtually always include toilet facilities (suitable for disabled people),
  information boards, some tables and chairs, and garbage bins.  Very often
  there's something else, like a playground or a scenic viewpoint.  There are
  about 350 of these rest areas in the country.  In Finland you'd be lucky to
  get a simple toilet.</p>

<p>3. This particular rest area, for example, features a Saab AJ 37 Viggen strike fighter.
  The fighter comes from Saab factories in Trollhättan.  Its various modifications
  (strike fighter and interceptor were most common) were the backbone of Swedish
  Air Force from 1970s to 1990s.  There were 329 Viggens built; all of them served
  in Sweden itself and were never sold to any other country.  Viggen was supposedly the first
  mass produced place to use integrated circuits in its avionics, and to implement
  "canard" design (a small "secondary" wing ahead of the main one).  It was also 
  originally supposed to carry Swedish nuclear weapons.  Yes you read that right,
  Sweden once had its own nuclear weapons program.  The idea was to build some
  tactical nukes for possible defense against Soviet Union (who else?), and Sweden
  got far enough to consider beginning tests. Eventually
  the Swedes decided the whole idea was just gross and scrapped the program in 1966. </p>

<p>4. Viggens <i>(Swed. Thunderbolt)</i> were replaced by the multipurpose
JAS 39 Gripen <i>(Swed. Griffin)</i> in the 1990s.  </p>

<p>5. I think it's a pretty neat plane, anyway.  It was put here because
  the largest air base of Sweden, F 7 Såtenäs, is located nearby.

<p>7. And here's Uppsala.  Hi Uppsala!  We left our car at a parking lot near
  the university, and walked quite a bit to our hotel near the railway station.
  The hotel was called <i>Centralstation</i> as well.
</p>

<p>The hotel deserves a special mention, as the smallest and most cramped accomodation ever.
  Even tiny camping cabins do not feel that claustrophobic.
  The room was about a size of my bathroom at home, and lacked any windows.
  2/3 of its area was occupied by a bunk bed.  Thankfully at least it had its own  (even tinier) bathroom.
  I didn't take my own pics but <a href="http://hotellcentralstation.se/vara-rum/medium-twin/" target="_blank">here</a>
  it is at their website.  Breakfast was very nice though.</p>

width="800" height="532" alt="9" title="Evening Uppsala" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>9. We walked a bit around evening Uppsala.  Honestly it seemed kinda boring.
  Maybe we were just too tired of trips by that point, or maybe that's just like Uppsala
  is.  We dined at some Italian restaurant and went to bed.</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/500/20198330942_0ce19814ee_o.jpg"

width="800" height="532" alt="10" title="University botanical garden" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>10. Uppsala is known for several things.  First, there's Uppsala University.
  It's pretty well known, as the oldest university in all Nordic countries
  (established in 1477).  The university is now second to Stockholm, but it's 
  still huge, taking up much of the area of the city.  We didn't see any of
  the major buildings of the campus, but here is its botanical garden, right
  across the castle.
</p>

<p><a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/556/20019904039_f87a747009_o.jpg"

width="800" height="532" alt="11" title="Uppsala Castle" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>11. And here's the castle.  Time for some history of Uppsala I guess.
  Old Uppsala <i>(Gamla Uppsala)</i> was known as the capital of what would
  become Sweden since the first millennium.  Kings of the semi-mythical
  Yngling dynasty ruled there, and Thing of All Swedes, the yearly governing
  assembly of free people, also took place in Old Uppsala.  And of course
  there was the great pagan Temple of Uppsala with huge idols of Norse gods.
  After conversion to Christianity Old Uppsala was eventually overtaken in
  significance by the nearby Östra Aros village, and when the construction
  of a new huge cathedral started in Östra Aros, it was officially renamed
  to Uppsala.  Gamla Uppsala still exists as a village a few kilometers
  north of Uppsala, but there's not much to see there; just a small ancient
  church and a few huge burial mounds.  According to old legends, Norse gods
  Thor, Odin, and Freyr are buried there; in reality they're more likely to 
  belong to some first millennium kings.   
</p>

<p>New Uppsala thus was the capital of Sweden before Stockholm.  It took
  a century and a half to build the huge cathedral, and it wasn't consecrated
  until 1435.  The Archbishop's Castle was located next to the cathedral, until  
  King Gustav Vasa carried out protestant reformation in 16th century.
  He ordered the Archbishop's Castle demolished and built his own castle from
  its material in 1549.  The castle was badly damaged by a fire in 1702.
  By that time the capital had already been moved to Stockholm.  The rest
  of Uppsala history was fairly quiet.  Modern population is 140,000 (187,500
  metropolitan area).  Doesn't seem like much but this is the fourth largest
  city in Sweden.  The rest of the cities have population of no more than
  100,000-110,000.</p>

width="800" height="532" alt="12" title="Gustav Vasa monument" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>12. Gustav Vasa is easy to recognize on paintings and monuments.
  He's a big guy with a huge beard.
</p>

width="800" height="532" alt="14" title="Gustav Vasa's cannons" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>14. A particularly cool fact about Gustav Vasa is that he didn't stop
  at destroying Archbishop's Castle and replacing it with his own; he also put
  a few cannons near the castle and permanently aimed them at the cathedral,
  just to make a point and to prevent archbishops from having any funny ideas.
</p>

<p>15. The castle is built on a hill and surrounded by a small park.  For
  some reason there were lots of huge whitish snails in that park.  (And 
  the same nasty black slugs we saw in Stockholm, too.)
</p>

<p>16. Almost as cute as Bohuslän crabs. </p>

width="800" height="532" alt="17" title="Queen Christina" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>17. Queen Christina (ruled in 1632-1654, although her coronation only
  took place in 1650, and before that due to her age Sweden was mostly
  ruled by Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna).  By all accounts, she was a very
  unusual queen.  She was very interested in religion, philosophy, and
  sciences, but never particularly wanted to rule.  She also publicly declared
  that she intended to never marry.  She didn't look very feminine and
  dressed like a man; historians believe she was a lesbian.  Thus only four
  years after her coronation, she abdicated her throne of her own free will.
  There was a big sigh of relief from everyone (she really wasn't a very good ruler,
  and was very careless about spending her treasury in particular),
  and the throne went to her cousin, Charles X Gustav, while she immediately
  converted to Catholicism, and moved to Rome where she spent most of the 
  rest of her fairly long and extravagant life chatting with Popes. 
  I guess the lesson is "don't be afraid to pursue your dreams even if you
  are the Queen of Sweden, and your dream is to be an Italian socialite".

<p>22. A list of all Archbishops of Uppsala, starting in 12th century.  The Archbishop
  is effectively the head of Swedish church.  The Archbishop since 2014 has, for the 
  first time ever, been a woman, Antje Jackelén.

<p>23. Gustav Vasa himself, along with all three of his wives (he was twice widowed),
  is buried in the cathedral in an exquisitely decorated tomb.
</p>

<p>25. The only other king buried in the cathedral is John III, Gustav Vasa's
  second son.  (His first son, Eric XIV, went insane and was deposed, so, no tomb for him.)
  I like his relaxed pose.
</p>

<p>26. St. Lars, St. Erik, and St. Olaf, saints to whom the cathedral is dedicated.  
  Erik was an ancient Swedish king and patron saint of Sweden, Olaf
  was an ancient Norwegian king and patron saint of Norway,
  and Lars is more commonly known as St. Lawrence.  St. Lars is missing
  his head for some reason, but this is possibly due to some restoration;
  I don't think he's supposed to look like that.

<p>28. After visiting the cathedral, we walked around Uppsala for an hour or two.
  This is the City Hall.

<p>33. Uppsala is in just 70 km from Stockholm, and the drive is trivial, down the
  huge E4 motorway.  I got a bit lost in Stockholm again, but in the end I found
  the Londonviadukten parking lot right across the ferry terminal, same one we used a year before.  
  When I went to pay for parking, some Swede ran to me, shouted that they were leaving early,
  and gave me his parking ticket, valid until next morning or so.  </p>

<p>The ship at the terminal is not our ferry (which was going to be <i>Amorella</i>),
but rather <i>Cinderella</i>, working on Stockholm&nbsp;&mdash;Mariehamn (Åland Islands)
line.  Our ferry has not arrived yet.</p>

<p>34. We walked around a bit, climbing the Södermalm cliffs this time.</p>

<p>36. It's always fun to find the traces of fellow Russians abroad.
  This is the most famous word of Russian language.  It means "dick".

<p>37. We ate a bit at some Old Town restaurant, and then returned to the terminal.
  I've never seen that many empty bottles at once.  Of course I don't think they all
  come from a single cruise, but still. </p>

<p>38. We boarded <i>Amorella</i> ferry.  As I mentioned, it is much older
than <i>Viking Grace</i>, and our cheap cabin was on the deck number two,
under the waterline and next to the engines.  It still was alright though.
We used our last money to buy another all-you-can-eat dinner.</p>

<p>40. I don't have any pictures for the rest of the return trip.  We just wanted
  to get home as fast as possible.  For some reason we were all quite hung over
  the next morning.  Finnish police at Turku just happened to check all drivers
  leaving the ferry with breathalyzers, and I got quite nervous, but apparently I
  was fine.  We stopped to grab some cheap horrible Finnish coffee after driving 100 km,
  and the rest was one non-stop drive.  Well, excluding the border crossing of course,
  and the customary refueling on the Russian side&nbsp;&mdash; I managed to avoid
  refueling in Finland, driving on the last drops of gas, to avoid their 2.5x more
  expensive fuel.  Some more hours and...</p>

<p>41. It's over.  3313 km, two major ferry crossings, ten and a half days,
  and probably about 70,000-80,000 rubles per person.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>This was my second major road trip.  Parts of it were similar to first one, in April-May
  2014, when we rented a car in Helsinki, took a Turku-Stockholm ferry, and drove to Flåm
  in Western Norwegian fjords.  This time, the trip was longer, and I drove my own car.</p>
  
<p>This time, I got to know Sweden significantly better, and saw a bit of Denmark for the first
  time.  Neither Sweden nor Denmark are my favorite countries (those would be Finland and Norway
  of course), but both of them are very interesting in their own right.  Sweden and Denmark
  are generally more suited for more traditional tourism and sightseeing, while Finland and 
  Norway are more about beautiful nature.</p>
  
<p>I would again greatly recommend Stockholm to everyone, and Copenhagen too.  Both Öland
  and Bohuslän shore are also excellent if unusual locations for a relaxed vacation.  Uppsala and Malmö on
  the other hand aren't really worth a detour by themselves.</p>
  
<p>And honestly I didn't plan this trip very well.  Too much driving and not enough focus.  
  It could have actually been even worse (for example, we considered a very brief detour
  through Norway), but this felt rushed even as it was.  In hindsight, we should have just
  went to Copenhagen or to Öland for a week.  Although pitching Öland to my friends would
  not have been trivial.</p>
  
<p>Anyway, this was a very nice vacation, and a great trip.  And now I can move over to the next one,
  to Finnish Lapland!  I've been waiting for it for ages!</p>
