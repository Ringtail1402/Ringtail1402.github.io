<p>Year 2016 has finally been the year&nbsp;I had both the time and the means to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;kind of&nbsp;journey
I&nbsp;really always dreamed about. Sure, <a href="/en/2015/11/06/sweden0/">Sweden</a> and especially
<a href="/en/2016/01/25/lappi0/">Lapland</a> last year were quite nice, but Sweden felt too
rushed overall, and Lapland trip, while a&nbsp;completely surreal experience for&nbsp;me, still had a
rather limited scope. So&nbsp;I&nbsp;allocated a&nbsp;pretty huge sum of&nbsp;money for the summer of&nbsp;2016,
and booked three vacations in&nbsp;a&nbsp;row at&nbsp;work. And the first one, in&nbsp;July, was going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the longest. 
Two weeks, or&nbsp;16&nbsp;days, including the preceding weekend.</p>

<p>This time my&nbsp;only companion was my&nbsp;friend Olga. We&nbsp;originally wanted to&nbsp;do&nbsp;a&nbsp;trip to&nbsp;Iceland.
We&nbsp;drew up&nbsp;an&nbsp;itinerary and all, but ultimately, decided to&nbsp;go&nbsp;with something else. While in&nbsp;theory
we&nbsp;could afford Iceland, the margin for error was going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;rather thin. Plane tickets to&nbsp;Iceland
cost a&nbsp;lot, and then of&nbsp;course you have to&nbsp;rent a&nbsp;car there, or&nbsp;you&rsquo;re not going to&nbsp;see much of 
Iceland<sup>*</sup>.</p>

<p><i><sup>*</sup> Actually, there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;visit Iceland while driving your own car. There is&nbsp;a&nbsp;ferry line
connecting Iceland with Denmark, via Faeroe Islands. The ferry trip is&nbsp;long and costs a&nbsp;fortune too,
though, and just driving to&nbsp;Denmark isn&rsquo;t a&nbsp;very small undertaking in&nbsp;itself. Of&nbsp;course&nbsp;I still
want to&nbsp;do&nbsp;this someday too!</i></p>

<p>Well, our next choice was Northern Norway. We&nbsp;had had only a&nbsp;fleeting experience with Norway before, 
just enough to&nbsp;know it&nbsp;is&nbsp;utterly amazing and really the most beautiful place on&nbsp;earth. On&nbsp;my
Lapland journey&nbsp;I actually drove a&nbsp;bit around <a href="/en/2016/02/17/lappi8/">a&nbsp;small bit of
Northern Norway</a>, but didn&rsquo;t have the time even for a&nbsp;small bit of&nbsp;hiking. Well, we&nbsp;intended
this time to&nbsp;be&nbsp;quite different!</p>

<p>As&nbsp;a&nbsp;matter of&nbsp;fact, there are two ways to&nbsp;drive to&nbsp;Northern Norway from St. Petersburg, Russia.
First, you can go&nbsp;through Finland. It&rsquo;s a&nbsp;pretty safe bet; the quality of&nbsp;the roads is&nbsp;very nice,
the traffic is&nbsp;fairly light, and there are many routes you can choose. There are six border
crossings from Finland to&nbsp;Norway. The only downside is&nbsp;that driving through most of&nbsp;Finland
is&nbsp;relatively boring. Apart from some parts of&nbsp;Lapland and Karelia, the views are decidedly
unimpressive. Unless you happen to&nbsp;like trees <i>a&nbsp;lot</i>, I&nbsp;mean.</p>

<p>The other option&nbsp;is, of&nbsp;course, going through Russia! I&nbsp;got my&nbsp;driving license in&nbsp;January 2013,
and clocked at&nbsp;least some 70,000 kilometers by&nbsp;July 2016, but&nbsp;I was still very wary of&nbsp;driving
extended distances in&nbsp;Russia. Narrow and sometimes poor roads, lots and lots of&nbsp;suicidally reckless drivers,
and usually quite significant traffic with a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;overloaded trucks do&nbsp;not really make for
a&nbsp;nice driving experience too. Still, the St. Petersburg&nbsp;&mdash; Petrozavodsk &mdash;
Murmansk&nbsp;&mdash; Norwegian border road, the Kola Route (signposted as&nbsp;M-18&nbsp;or more properly
R-21) was, as&nbsp;far as&nbsp;I&nbsp;knew, a&nbsp;fairly nice one as&nbsp;far as&nbsp;Russian roads&nbsp;go. And we&rsquo;d get to&nbsp;visit
two major Russian cities we&nbsp;would be&nbsp;unlikely to&nbsp;visit otherwise: Petrozavodsk and Murmansk!</p>

<p>So&nbsp;in&nbsp;the end we&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;Norway via Russia, and back via Finland. Over overall 
itinerary looked like this:
</p>

<p><img class="img-thumbnail" src="/assets/misc-img/nord-norge-1.jpg" title="Trip Map" alt="Trip Map"></p>

<p>The letters do&nbsp;not mean anything, sorry. It&rsquo;s surprisingly difficult to&nbsp;draw a&nbsp;non-trivial map
with Google!</p>

<p>After a&nbsp;lot more of&nbsp;Googling, we&nbsp;decided that the places in&nbsp;Northern Norway we&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;visit were,
from east to&nbsp;west: Varanger Fjord and Peninsula (particularly the town of&nbsp;Vard&oslash;), the North Cape,
Lyngen Alps Mountains, the city of&nbsp;Troms&oslash;, and Senja Island. This list actually more or&nbsp;less matches
most of&nbsp;the major tourist attractions of&nbsp;Northern Norway, with the exception of&nbsp;Lofoten Islands,
which are probably worth a&nbsp;whole vacation by&nbsp;themselves. For most of&nbsp;these places, we&nbsp;planned 
a&nbsp;2-3 days long stay, allowing&nbsp;us to&nbsp;visit several local attractions at&nbsp;a&nbsp;leisurely pace. The drives
between these areas were on&nbsp;the other hand fairly long, up&nbsp;to&nbsp;over 500&nbsp;km in&nbsp;a&nbsp;single day
(Vard&oslash;-Honningsv&aring;g leg), which is&nbsp;actually very exhausting on&nbsp;Norwegian roads.</p>

<p>Finland, while of&nbsp;course holding a&nbsp;very special place in&nbsp;my&nbsp;heart, was not going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;major 
destination of&nbsp;us this time. The only place we&nbsp;planned to&nbsp;visit in&nbsp;Finland was Treriksr&ouml;set
three border stone, yes, <a href="/en/2016/02/13/lappi7/">again</a>. I&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;see what it&rsquo;s
like in&nbsp;summer, to&nbsp;show the hike to&nbsp;my&nbsp;friend, and to&nbsp;try an&nbsp;overnight stay in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<i>varaustupa</i>
reservable wilderness hut. After Treriksr&ouml;set it&nbsp;was going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;pretty much a&nbsp;non stop drive
across the entire Finland to&nbsp;Russia, with a&nbsp;single overnight stay in&nbsp;Southern Lapland.</p>

<p><img class="img-thumbnail" src="/assets/misc-img/nord-norge-2.jpg" title="Trip Map, Zoomed" alt="Trip Map, Zoomed"></p>

<p>Well, our plan worked out splendidly! It&nbsp;turned out the pace we&nbsp;chose was exactly right, and we&nbsp;drove
over 5700&nbsp;km across Russia, Norway, and Finland without any incident, and we&nbsp;visited nearly all the locations
we&nbsp;wanted, with just some two or&nbsp;three exceptions. Even our journey budget ended up&nbsp;being fairly precise!</p>

<p>Our sole means of&nbsp;transportation was the same as&nbsp;in&nbsp;previous year, my &rsquo;15 Renault Sandero. I&nbsp;love
that car. Well, not literally; I&nbsp;make a&nbsp;point of&nbsp;never becoming attached to&nbsp;any possessions;
but it&nbsp;suits me&nbsp;so&nbsp;well. Simple and trusty and reliable, never a&nbsp;single problem in&nbsp;50,000&nbsp;km apart
from burned-out lightbulbs, and it&nbsp;allowed me&nbsp;to&nbsp;visit so&nbsp;many places&nbsp;&mdash; and even the northermost 
part of&nbsp;Europe now. I&nbsp;really think Renault should pay me&nbsp;something for the marketing!</p>

<p>I&nbsp;ended up&nbsp;taking many thousands of&nbsp;pictures, of&nbsp;course. I&rsquo;m not even sure how many. The lack of&nbsp;space
on&nbsp;my&nbsp;MacBook Pro (well it&rsquo;s corporate but&nbsp;I can take it&nbsp;anywhere I&nbsp;want) with its 256&nbsp;GB SSD drive
was a&nbsp;very severe concern, and&nbsp;I had to&nbsp;remove duplicates and bad pictures, and process RAW files right
on&nbsp;the road. And soon after&nbsp;I got back, my&nbsp;other two vacations followed, so&nbsp;that explains why&nbsp;I began
to&nbsp;write things down only four months later.</p>

<p>There are going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;posts, and&nbsp;I plan to&nbsp;start with a&nbsp;few introductory ones, just telling
about the land I&nbsp;saw. Because it&rsquo;s really an&nbsp;amazing land and the most wonderful place on&nbsp;earth.
The rest of&nbsp;the posts will be&nbsp;more chronological.</p>
