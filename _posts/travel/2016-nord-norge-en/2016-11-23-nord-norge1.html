<p>So. This is&nbsp;Norway:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Europe-Norway.svg"><img class="img-thumbnail"
                   src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Europe-Norway.svg/571px-Europe-Norway.svg.png"
                   title="Norway on Europe map, courtesy of Wikipedia" alt="Norway on Europe map, courtesy of Wikipedia"></a></p>

<p>One thing you can immediately notice is&nbsp;that it&nbsp;is&nbsp;the northernmost country of&nbsp;Europe, even excluding Svalbard,
those islands very far up&nbsp;north (actually a&nbsp;shared Norwegian-Russian possession). A&nbsp;large fraction of&nbsp;Norway
in&nbsp;fact lies beyond the Arctic Circle.</p>

<p>Another thing you can notice is&nbsp;that its coastline is&nbsp;very rough and irregular, which is&nbsp;very obvious even on&nbsp;such a&nbsp;small
map. The irregularities are in&nbsp;fact the famous Norwegian fjords. The whole country, excluding only the very south,
pretty much consists of&nbsp;fjords, mountains, and mountain plateaus. This is&nbsp;in&nbsp;fact the consequence of&nbsp;its
northern location. Most of&nbsp;modern Finland, Sweden, and Norway was completely covered by&nbsp;a&nbsp;huge glacier in&nbsp;the Ice Age.
The glacier ended up&nbsp;shaping these countries to&nbsp;what they are today. In&nbsp;Finland, for example, it&nbsp;scraped away the relatively thin sedimentary layer to
expose the bedrock and gouge innumerable lakes. But Norway is&nbsp;very much unlike Finland in&nbsp;that it&nbsp;has actual mountains,
the Scandinavian Mountains, formed 400 million years ago. The glacier carved enormous precipitous valleys between these
mountains, which, once flooded, became fjords. Accidentally, it&nbsp;turns out these fjords are among the most beautiful places in&nbsp;the
world.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to&nbsp;say how many fjords there are in&nbsp;Norway, as&nbsp;they vary enormously in&nbsp;size, and many major fjords in&nbsp;fact
branch into numerous arms, forming a&nbsp;fractal-shaped landscape. The best known fjords are located in 
Western Norway, but from the map you can see that the very north looks also quite fjord-y as&nbsp;well.</p> 

<p><a id="1" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8648/28436366370_bbed73012b_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8648/28436366370_0dae1fe794_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8648/28436366370_506cef1bcd_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="1" title="Varangerfjorden" class="img-thumbnail"></a> <br>
<i>Varangerfjorden somewhere between Kirkenes and Varangerbotn</i></p>

<p>1. It&nbsp;turns out that, for the most part, the northernmost fjords are less precipitous and thus look somewhat
less dramatic. The Scandinavian Mountains somewhat flatten off in&nbsp;the very north, giving way to&nbsp;Lapland
fell landscape in&nbsp;inland regions. </p>

<p><a id="2" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8825/28104782303_fbbc3c9978_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8825/28104782303_cc8e90465e_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8825/28104782303_4fefad7f94_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="2" title="Lyngenfjorden" class="img-thumbnail"></a> <br>
<i>Some part of&nbsp;Lyngenfjorden</i></p>

<p>2. You&rsquo;d have to&nbsp;drive really far north to&nbsp;experience that &ldquo;flattening&rdquo; though. Fjords in&nbsp;the vicinity of
Troms&oslash; still look fairly respectable, for example.
</p>

<p><a id="3" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8543/28643076171_b177bbdc63_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8543/28643076171_5f2e559116_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8543/28643076171_f339d20eb2_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="3" title="Långfjord (Pasvik)" class="img-thumbnail"></a> <br>
<i>L&aring;ngfjord (Pasvik)</i></p>

<p>3. Northern Norway is&nbsp;pretty much the northernmost place in&nbsp;the world you can visit without 
being some sort of&nbsp;a&nbsp;hardcore Arctic enthusiast. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;perhaps somewhat surprising then that the climate
here is&nbsp;relatively mild. Of&nbsp;course the summer is&nbsp;short and the winters aren&rsquo;t particularly nice,
but it&rsquo;s not really enormously cold. Finnish Lapland (or&nbsp;Inner Finnmark regions in&nbsp;Northern Norway, which are
pretty much the Norwegian Lapland) is&nbsp;much colder, for example. The Gulf Stream flows along the entire coastline of&nbsp;Norway,
and moderates climate as&nbsp;far north as&nbsp;the North Cape; its average January temperature is&nbsp;only &minus;3&nbsp;&deg;C.
No&nbsp;worse than in&nbsp;St. Petersburg! 
</p>


<p><a id="4" href="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7469/28104872223_b154ec9385_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7469/28104872223_f7528e9590_c.jpg 1x, https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7469/28104872223_f6420e789b_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="4" title="Gryllefjorden (Senja)" class="img-thumbnail"></a> <br>
<i>Gryllefjorden (Senja)</i></p>

<p>4. Of&nbsp;course, as&nbsp;is&nbsp;everywhere beyond the Arctic Circle, you get the polar night, and the midnight sun. Neither
lasts all that long, and neither is&nbsp;as&nbsp;dramatic as&nbsp;it&nbsp;sounds; at&nbsp;midday during polar night you get
some fairly light bluish twilight, and at&nbsp;midnight during midnight sun you get just a&nbsp;very extended
sunset. In&nbsp;Norway midnight sun actually often gets obscured by&nbsp;the landscape (the fjords and the mountains).
We&nbsp;were there during the midnight sun period ourselves, but&nbsp;I couldn&rsquo;t really even get a 
picture of&nbsp;the midnight sun. Of&nbsp;course I&rsquo;m pretty lazy about getting out and taking pictures at&nbsp;night, anyway.
</p>

<p>Northern lights are of&nbsp;course the huge attraction of&nbsp;the north, but obviously you cannot see them in&nbsp;midnight sun
months, so&nbsp;I won&rsquo;t show you any pictures of&nbsp;them as&nbsp;well. Overall I&rsquo;d say if&nbsp;you don&rsquo;t specifically want to&nbsp;go
here in&nbsp;winter (which might be&nbsp;particularly challenging if&nbsp;you intend to&nbsp;drive, which you should),
the best month is&nbsp;early September. The weather is&nbsp;still fairly warm, there won&rsquo;t be&nbsp;a&nbsp;trace of&nbsp;any mosquitoes,
and the daylight hours are still fairly long, but you&rsquo;ll still get proper night, and thus a&nbsp;very good chance of
seeing some northern lights.</p> 

<p><a id="5" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8368/28687814996_85a8e5fcf9_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8368/28687814996_5f5ac26808_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8368/28687814996_c6121e59ef_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="5" title="Okshornan" class="img-thumbnail"></a> <br>
<i>At&nbsp;the beach at&nbsp;the bottom of&nbsp;Ersfjorden (Senja), with Okshornan Mountains in&nbsp;the background</i></p>

<p>5. Some fjords even have beaches where you can swim&nbsp;at! If&nbsp;you feel adventurous enough, of&nbsp;course. </p>

<p><a id="6" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8852/28643070811_be36dc335d_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8852/28643070811_fc472f3201_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8852/28643070811_f8457fd9be_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="6" title="Pasvikelva River" class="img-thumbnail"></a> <br>
<i>Pasvikelva River</i></p>

<p>6. Inland locations like Inner Finnmark or&nbsp;Pasvik may look a&nbsp;lot like Finland at&nbsp;places. Nothing wrong
with that, but this is&nbsp;probably not the kind of&nbsp;landscapes you came to&nbsp;Norway for. Additionally, 
mosquitoes in&nbsp;May-July season are extremely nasty there! Conversely, there are almost no&nbsp;mosquitoes near the coast or
in&nbsp;the mountains. 
</p>

<p><a id="7" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8857/28643069571_1a859ebd49_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8857/28643069571_236bab8325_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8857/28643069571_613fe30615_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="7" title="Near Vintervollvatnet" class="img-thumbnail"></a> <br>
<i>Near Vintervollvatnet Lake, at&nbsp;the road to&nbsp;Grense Jakobselv</i></p>

<p>7. Thus in&nbsp;Northern Norway you generally want to&nbsp;see the fjords and the mountains&nbsp;&mdash; same as&nbsp;in&nbsp;the
rest of&nbsp;the Norway really. And if&nbsp;you want to&nbsp;get that &ldquo;hey I&rsquo;m really in&nbsp;the goddamn Arctic&rdquo; feel,
you have two options. First, you can go&nbsp;up! Arctic tundra replaces the usual boreal forest at&nbsp;rather
low elevations, sometimes as&nbsp;low as&nbsp;100&nbsp;m. Just drive up&nbsp;some minor road, or&nbsp;hike onto some plateau.</p>

<p><a id="8" href="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7546/28687919586_2b3db73990_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7546/28687919586_c444cab25f_c.jpg 1x, https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7546/28687919586_51f1b34d5c_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="8" title="Magerøya Island landscapes" class="img-thumbnail"></a> <br>
<i>Mager&oslash;ya Island landscapes</i></p>

<p>8. The other option is&nbsp;to&nbsp;go&nbsp;<i>really</i> far north. Only a&nbsp;few locations in&nbsp;Northern Norway can really
be&nbsp;considered proper Arctic (which can be&nbsp;roughly defined as&nbsp;the region where trees are nearly completely
absent, and the tundra starts right at&nbsp;the sea level). These are Varanger Peninsula, northern Porsanger
Peninsula, Mager&oslash;ya Island, and some smaller islands and peninsulae in&nbsp;their vicinity. Mager&oslash;ya Island is
probably the best known, as&nbsp;this is&nbsp;where the North Cape is&nbsp;located. The entire island, which is&nbsp;pretty huge,
looks just like that&nbsp;&mdash; rocky tundra with some fells and lakes. </p>

<p><a id="9" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8867/28103122164_43a5d6a06b_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8867/28103122164_3a0b9cbe52_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8867/28103122164_b67a2c5cd3_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="9" title="Cloudberries" class="img-thumbnail"></a> <br>
<i>Cloudberries at&nbsp;the Knivskjellodden Cape</i>
</p>

<p>9. By&nbsp;the way, cloudberries are not quite as&nbsp;common in&nbsp;the tundra as&nbsp;you might think. We&nbsp;only saw 
a&nbsp;few. Maybe we&nbsp;just missed the season, of&nbsp;course.
</p>

<p><a id="10" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8712/28643068801_d788569b9b_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8712/28643068801_175f23d350_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8712/28643068801_e9bad08bfc_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="10" title="Barentz Sea" class="img-thumbnail"></a> <br>
<i>Barentz Sea coast at&nbsp;Grense Jakobselv</i>
</p>

<p>10. The Norwegian Sea stretches along most of&nbsp;the Norwegian coast up&nbsp;until the North Cape, where it&nbsp;changes
into the Barentz Sea. The open sea, outside of&nbsp;any fjords, often looks exactly as&nbsp;gloomy and harsh as&nbsp;you&rsquo;d expect.
</p>

<p><a id="11" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8818/28688043636_a1efc051b8_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8818/28688043636_4bfbe2a520_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8818/28688043636_02000b23ab_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="11" title="Route E75 on Varanger Peninsula" class="img-thumbnail"></a> <br>
<i>Route E75 in&nbsp;the east of&nbsp;Varanger Peninsula</i></p>

<p>11. The sea depends on&nbsp;the weather, of&nbsp;course, and the weather up&nbsp;here can be&nbsp;extremely volatile. </p>

<p><a id="12" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8678/28688042206_3e8c2ccbb3_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8678/28688042206_0d323e9b78_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8678/28688042206_fa877155a6_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="12" title="Route E75 on Varanger Peninsula" class="img-thumbnail"></a> <br>
<i>Same road about 10&nbsp;minutes later</i></p>

<p>12. This is&nbsp;the very same road just some ten minutes later. The weather is&nbsp;more often gloomy and overcast
than not. And while you probably won&rsquo;t get an&nbsp;actual storm, it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;a&nbsp;<i>very</i> good idea to&nbsp;bring
clothes which can shield against the wind well. As&nbsp;is&nbsp;probably expected, it&nbsp;gets very strong in&nbsp;open
tundra landscapes. </p>

<p><a id="13" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8519/28104987893_9b3afa1308_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8519/28104987893_313aa53f01_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8519/28104987893_ca6b8036ac_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="13" title="Stockfish" class="img-thumbnail"></a> <br>
<i>Stockfish drying rack in&nbsp;Honningsv&aring;g</i></p>

<p>13. The entire Norway has a&nbsp;population of&nbsp;only 5&nbsp;million, and of&nbsp;course the North is&nbsp;populated particularly
thinly. Only a&nbsp;few towns exceed 3,000 in&nbsp;population. One of&nbsp;the obvious local livelihoods is&nbsp;fishing.
Racks for cod drying are encountered in&nbsp;every village, although by&nbsp;July they should generally be&nbsp;all empty;
the drying-out supposedly takes place from February to&nbsp;May. 
</p>

<p><a id="14" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8050/28642777141_afc43d2d90_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8050/28642777141_595f529b76_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8050/28642777141_59fb5f7473_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="14" title="Seal hunting" class="img-thumbnail"></a> <br>
<i>Seal hunting, as&nbsp;displayed in&nbsp;the Arctic Museum in&nbsp;Troms&oslash;</i></p>

<p>14. Seal hunting are whaling are still actually practiced despite the &ldquo;family unfriendly&rdquo; image,
although the volumes are not especially high. Various whales in&nbsp;fact commonly inhabit fjords.
There are whale-watching tours, and in&nbsp;principle you should in&nbsp;theory be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;spot a&nbsp;whale or&nbsp;two
if&nbsp;you just look at&nbsp;a&nbsp;fjord long enough. Personally so&nbsp;far&nbsp;I have never seen a&nbsp;whale.</p>

<p><a id="15" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8721/28720548185_913d0fab79_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8721/28720548185_b8aa91d403_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8721/28720548185_1b71ca29be_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="15" title="Sheep" class="img-thumbnail"></a> <br>
<i>Sheep near Route E75&nbsp;on Varanger Peninsula</i></p>

<p>15. Outside of&nbsp;tundra areas, sheep husbandry is&nbsp;rather common. My&nbsp;friends loves to&nbsp;affectionally call
them &ldquo;food&rdquo;. Crop fields on&nbsp;the other hand are rarely seen, especially big ones; the climate north of&nbsp;about
Troms&oslash; is&nbsp;too harsh to&nbsp;sustain crop production, and the terrain is&nbsp;not very favourable as&nbsp;well. 
</p>

<p><a id="16" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8383/28102916514_05031427ab_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8383/28102916514_eef25cc05c_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8383/28102916514_345ade1027_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="16" title="Reindeer" class="img-thumbnail"></a> <br>
<i>Reindeer near the road to&nbsp;Grense Jakobselv</i></p>

<p>16. You might wonder when will&nbsp;I finally mention reindeer. Well there they are! Reindeer! 
It&rsquo;s the single most common sight that you are in&nbsp;the Arctic. You may drive through a&nbsp;nondescript
forest not particularly different from Southern Finland or&nbsp;for example Russia, yet still occasionally
meet a&nbsp;reindeer or&nbsp;two or&nbsp;even a&nbsp;small herd. Reindeer are semi-domesticated animals; they graze
by&nbsp;themselves, pretty much anywhere they like, but they all belong to&nbsp;someone, and eventually they
(somehow) get herded together. They are used for meat, skins, milk, and as&nbsp;pack animals, although
the latter use is&nbsp;probably rare by&nbsp;now, outside of&nbsp;tourist industry. It&rsquo;s a&nbsp;pity such beautiful 
animals get slaughtered, really; I&nbsp;consider them the second cutest animals in&nbsp;the world, after rabbits.</p>


<p><a id="17" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8851/28104922093_5a7f629d06_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8851/28104922093_f586cd6fef_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8851/28104922093_31c913af65_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="17" title="Reindeer blocking the road" class="img-thumbnail"></a> <br>
<i>Reindeer blocking Finnmark County Road 98</i></p>

<p>17. Reindeer can be&nbsp;met in&nbsp;the wilderness and on&nbsp;the outskirts of&nbsp;towns and villages, but you&rsquo;re most likely
to&nbsp;encounter them on&nbsp;the roads. They aren&rsquo;t very large and do&nbsp;not run randomly across the road (like moose),
so&nbsp;they do&nbsp;not present a&nbsp;major hazard to&nbsp;driving, provided you actually pay attention to&nbsp;the road (though
it&nbsp;gets worse after dark, unless again you&rsquo;re visiting in&nbsp;midnight sun months like we&nbsp;did). They can
however be&nbsp;pretty oblivious of&nbsp;the world around them, not entirely unlike a&nbsp;common cow, and may just block
the road if&nbsp;they feel like&nbsp;it. There is&nbsp;not much you can do&nbsp;in&nbsp;this case but to&nbsp;wait until they change
their mind; honking doesn&rsquo;t work. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;often said that the first few times you encounter reindeer while driving
it&nbsp;feels marvelous, but then they just get hugely annoying. I&nbsp;totally disagree. I&nbsp;still shout &ldquo;LOOK! REINDEER!&rdquo;
every time&nbsp;I see one. 
</p>

<i>Sami sled in&nbsp;Troms&oslash; University Museum</i></p>

<p>18. Reindeer husbandry has traditionally been practiced by&nbsp;the native people of&nbsp;the North, the Sami.
I&rsquo;m a&nbsp;huge fan of&nbsp;the Sami! (And please excuse me&nbsp;if&nbsp;you&rsquo;re an&nbsp;actual Sami and you think my&nbsp;descriptions
are inaccurate or&nbsp;insensitive in&nbsp;some way.) They aren&rsquo;t very numerous, with about 100,000 of&nbsp;them at&nbsp;most. They never 
had their own statehood, and now live in&nbsp;Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia alike; mostly in&nbsp;Norway,
though. They have their own language, or&nbsp;actually many dialects; the most common one is&nbsp;Northern Sami.
It&nbsp;uses Latin letters but looks very unusual, very faintly resembling Finnish (which is&nbsp;in&nbsp;itself very
unlike most of&nbsp;European languages). The Sami used to&nbsp;live in&nbsp;teepee-like huts, called <i>goahti</i>,
and wore colorful clothes, with lots of&nbsp;blue and red; a&nbsp;particularly notable item of&nbsp;clothing was their
four-pronged hat, called Hat of&nbsp;Four Winds. Visually they most closely
resemble the Finns, I&nbsp;think, although faintly Asian features are commonly mixed&nbsp;in.

<p>The Sami were significantly oppressed throughout centuries, so&nbsp;that for example their traditional 
shamanistic religion is&nbsp;pretty much forgotten, and so&nbsp;are traditional Sami names. Many branches
of&nbsp;their language are extinct or&nbsp;nearly extinct as&nbsp;well. Only some decades ago they were universally
recognized as&nbsp;a&nbsp;distinct people, and granted a&nbsp;degree of&nbsp;autonomy. There is&nbsp;even a&nbsp;Sami parliament
in&nbsp;Norway, in&nbsp;the town of&nbsp;Karasjok. Some regions in&nbsp;Finnish Lapland and Northern Norway are officially
bilingual, and municipality names etc. are duplicated in&nbsp;Northern Sami. Many remote locations 
(fells and the like) have only Sami names.</p>

<p>The most distinctly Sami part of&nbsp;Northern Norway is&nbsp;Inner Finnmark, the Finnmarksvidda Plateau, where
towns of&nbsp;Kautokeino and Karasjok, populated almost exclusively by&nbsp;the Sami, are located. Unfortunately
we&nbsp;didn&rsquo;t visit Inner Finnmark on&nbsp;our trip (although&nbsp;I had a&nbsp;brief look later in&nbsp;September). 
Many coastal communities are partially Sami as&nbsp;well. In&nbsp;general, apart from the reindeer-herding part, the Sami
now live just the same as&nbsp;everybody else, and even Kautokeino and Karasjok look pretty much nearly exactly
the same as&nbsp;any random Norwegian town.</p>

<i>Skolt Sami Orthodox Christian graveyard in&nbsp;Neiden</i></p>

<p>19. Northern Norway has had some significant Russian influence as&nbsp;well. The so-called Pomor trade
between coastal villages and Russians from Arkhangelsk region had been an&nbsp;important source of&nbsp;income
up&nbsp;until the Russian Revolution of&nbsp;1917. A&nbsp;Russian monastery in&nbsp;Pechenga, just to&nbsp;the east of
Norwegian-Russian border, spread Orthodox faith centuries ago. The Skolt Sami in&nbsp;particular 
still retain that faith. 
</p>

<p>It&nbsp;also was the Soviet Union that liberated the Northern Norway in&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the World War&nbsp;II, and,
just as&nbsp;importantly, had the decency to&nbsp;withdraw after that. Norway in&nbsp;general never had any wars
or&nbsp;significant disputes with Russia, although nowadays it&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;member of&nbsp;NATO, unlike Finland and Sweden.</p>

<i>Norway-Finland border crossing in&nbsp;Neiden/N&auml;&auml;t&auml;m&ouml;</i></p>

<p>20. There&rsquo;s only one border crossing to&nbsp;Russia now, but six border crossings to&nbsp;Finland. 
The distance from most settlements to&nbsp;the Finnish border might be&nbsp;hundreds of&nbsp;kilometers,
but those who happen to&nbsp;live close enough commonly visit supermarkets on&nbsp;the Finnish side of&nbsp;the border
for grocery shopping, as&nbsp;everything is&nbsp;significantly cheaper in&nbsp;Finland than in&nbsp;Norway. 
These supermarkets exist in&nbsp;most if&nbsp;not all Finnish border villages. Both Finland and Norway
are parts of&nbsp;the Schengen Agreement (even though Norway is&nbsp;not an&nbsp;EU member), so&nbsp;the border can be 
crossed freely by&nbsp;anyone. Random spot customs checks may still occur at&nbsp;borders though.

<i>Hamningberg, a&nbsp;rare old village in&nbsp;Finnmark County</i></p>

<p>21. Norway, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;country, consists of&nbsp;20&nbsp;counties, most of&nbsp;them with sufficiently Norse-sounding
names like Rogaland. Three of&nbsp;these counties belong to&nbsp;Northern Norway: Nordland, Troms, and Finnmark,
in&nbsp;order from the southernmost to&nbsp;the northernmost one (and from most populated to&nbsp;least populated one too). 
We&nbsp;only visited Troms and Finnmark on&nbsp;our trip. Nordland is&nbsp;the least Arctic-y of&nbsp;these counties 
anyway, although it&nbsp;has Lofoten Islands, which are a&nbsp;huge attraction in&nbsp;themselves.  Some or most of&nbsp;this post
might not apply to Nordland; I wouldn&rsquo;t know really.
</p>

<p>All the true-Arctic locations are in&nbsp;Finnmark, and most of&nbsp;the Sami villages are in&nbsp;Finnmark too
(in&nbsp;fact the word &ldquo;Finnmark&rdquo; refers not to&nbsp;Finland, but to&nbsp;an&nbsp;old name for the Sami). What it&nbsp;lacks
is&nbsp;major mountains and man-made attractions. Indeed, Finnmark, along with Finnish Lapland, was
nearly completely destroyed by&nbsp;Germans in&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the World War II. There weren&rsquo;t that many
casualties, but nearly all towns and villages were completely burned down. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, most 
of&nbsp;Finnmark and Finnish Lapland had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;rebuilt from scratch after the war, and looks relatively
uniform and bland. Surviving places, such as&nbsp;the remote village of&nbsp;Hamningberg, are few and far
between.</p>

<i>Vads&oslash; center</i></p>

<p>22. The town of&nbsp;Vads&oslash; is&nbsp;the center of&nbsp;Finnmark County, and is&nbsp;a&nbsp;fine example of&nbsp;what the center of
a&nbsp;typical Northern Norway town looks like.

<p>23. The biggest town in&nbsp;Finnmark is&nbsp;actually not Vads&oslash; but Alta, population 20,000 versus Vads&oslash;&rsquo;s 6,000.
It&nbsp;looks ever more bland. Not to&nbsp;say it&rsquo;s a&nbsp;bad place to&nbsp;live&nbsp;in, of&nbsp;course; it&nbsp;looks very cozy, like
any other Nordic town.

<i>Vard&oslash;</i></p>

<p>24. Some of&nbsp;the more remote settlements, away from trunk roads and tourist sights, look quite a&nbsp;bit more
austere and rough, like the tiny fishing town of&nbsp;Vard&oslash;, on&nbsp;a&nbsp;small island off the coast of&nbsp;Varanger &mdash;
the easternmost point of&nbsp;entire Norway, in&nbsp;fact. I&rsquo;d still absolutely live there of&nbsp;course.

<i>Vard&oslash;hus Fortress in&nbsp;Vard&oslash;</i></p>

<p>25. Vard&oslash; is&nbsp;actually the oldest town in&nbsp;the north by&nbsp;far, and it&nbsp;has the northernmost fortress in&nbsp;the world,
named Vard&oslash;hus. It&rsquo;s pretty tiny, and this is&nbsp;perhaps why it&nbsp;survived the WWII, unlike, again, the rest of
the town.

<i>Troms&oslash;, as&nbsp;seen from Storsteinen viewpoint</i></p>

<p>26. It&rsquo;s pretty clear which city is&nbsp;the actual capital of&nbsp;the Northern Norway nowadays, and that is
Troms&oslash;, which&nbsp;I have already mentioned several times before. Troms&oslash; is&nbsp;the center of&nbsp;Troms County
(who would&rsquo;ve guessed), and as&nbsp;such, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;surrounded by&nbsp;fairly respectable mountains. From
Storsteinen Mountain it&rsquo;s easy to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;look over the entire city (population 60,000), which neatly
fills a&nbsp;middle-sized island hidden between fjords and straits. 
</p>

<i>Troms&oslash; downtown</i></p>

<p>27. The city was nicknamed &ldquo;the Paris of&nbsp;the North&rdquo; as&nbsp;early as&nbsp;in&nbsp;the 19th century (although my&nbsp;friend
had actually seen Paris before and kept claiming Troms&oslash; was still nowhere like&nbsp;it). WWII fighting thankfully
didn&rsquo;t reach&nbsp;it, and the city retains its old charm.

<i>Tromsdalen and Arctic Cathedral</i></p>

<p>28. The most iconic building of&nbsp;Troms&oslash; is&nbsp;the Arctic Cathedral, actually located not in&nbsp;Troms&oslash; itself, but on
the mainland near the bridge to&nbsp;Troms&oslash;, at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;Tromsdalen Valley.

<p>29. Troms&oslash; is&nbsp;home to&nbsp;the northernmost university in&nbsp;the world as&nbsp;well, appropriately named
Arctic University. And to&nbsp;the northernmost brewery in&nbsp;the world, which makes beers with names like
&ldquo;Polar Bear&rdquo;, &ldquo;Northern Lights&rdquo;, or&nbsp;&ldquo;Arctic Beer&rdquo;. It&nbsp;looks like naming stuff is&nbsp;very easy if&nbsp;you live
beyond the Arctic Circle!

<i>North Cape</i></p>

<p>30. The biggest attraction of&nbsp;the Northern Norway is&nbsp;probably the North Cape (Nordkapp), the northernmost point of&nbsp;Europe,
on&nbsp;Mager&oslash;ya Island in&nbsp;Finnmark County.
It&rsquo;s somewhat of&nbsp;a&nbsp;tourist trap (it&nbsp;has a&nbsp;significant entry fee), but&nbsp;I still do&nbsp;absolutely recommend
to&nbsp;visit&nbsp;it. Its location is&nbsp;quite dramatic, on&nbsp;a&nbsp;300 meter tall cliff overlooking the endless
Barentz Sea, and on&nbsp;the way there (there&rsquo;s a&nbsp;decent road) you&rsquo;ll get to&nbsp;enjoy lots of&nbsp;stunningly beautiful tundra and fjord
landscapes.
</p>

<p><a id="31" href="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7762/28687940576_289940f29f_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7762/28687940576_688cf87f76_c.jpg 1x, https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7762/28687940576_133d4ef202_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="31" title="Knivskjellodden Cape" class="img-thumbnail"></a> <br>
<i>Knivskjellodden Cape as&nbsp;seen from the North Cape</i></p>

<p>31. The question of&nbsp;what exactly consitutes the northernmost point of&nbsp;Europe isn&rsquo;t that simple.
Svalbard is&nbsp;Europe too, after all, and if&nbsp;you agree to&nbsp;exclude islands then, well, the North Cape
is&nbsp;on&nbsp;an&nbsp;island too. The northernmost point of&nbsp;more-or-less-continuous Europe is&nbsp;also not the North Cape,
but actually the nearby Knivskjellodden Cape, which is&nbsp;about a&nbsp;kilometer and a&nbsp;half farther north.
It&nbsp;can be&nbsp;clearly seen from the North Cape, and a&nbsp;hiking trail goes there, although it&rsquo;s not the easiest one
(we&nbsp;still did&nbsp;it). </p>

<p><a id="32" href="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7755/28720535385_1feac7a9a8_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7755/28720535385_1f9b305c04_c.jpg 1x, https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7755/28720535385_b1e4204f2f_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="32" title="Lyngen Alps" class="img-thumbnail"></a> <br>
<i>Lyngen Alps Mountains from afar</i></p>

<p>32. Hiking in&nbsp;fact seems pretty much what Norway is&nbsp;meant for. Hiking to&nbsp;Knivskjellodden and in&nbsp;other tundra
areas is&nbsp;great if&nbsp;you enjoy huge open spaces (I&nbsp;do), but hiking in&nbsp;various mountains is&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;fun too,
and you do&nbsp;not have be&nbsp;into mountaineering&nbsp;&mdash; there are lots of&nbsp;trails perfectly accessible for casual
hiking&nbsp;&mdash; for example, in&nbsp;the Lyngen Alps, the tallest mountains north of&nbsp;Troms&oslash;, reaching over 1800 meters
of&nbsp;elevation. (Okay, if&nbsp;you want to&nbsp;climb its 1800 meters tall mountain, you probably actually do&nbsp;need
to&nbsp;know some mountaineering.)</p>

<p>33. You can even go&nbsp;hiking for multiple days without packing sleeping gear (and that stuff weighs a&nbsp;lot!),
if&nbsp;you plan carefully. There are reservable tourist huts available in&nbsp;most popular hiking destinations.

<i>Steindalselva River in&nbsp;Lyngen Alps</i></p>

<p>34. There are glaciers in&nbsp;the mountains. That&rsquo;s why there are many milky white or&nbsp;bluish rivers here &mdash;
these are glacial rivers carrying a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;deposit from the glacier above.

<i>Steindalsbreen Glacier in&nbsp;Lyngen Alps</i></p>

<p>35. It&rsquo;s not often that you get a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;see a&nbsp;glacier up&nbsp;close, huh? Of&nbsp;course getting to&nbsp;one requires
some hiking; you cannot just drive up&nbsp;there. If&nbsp;you want to&nbsp;proceed onto the glacier itself, there are
guided tours; walking on&nbsp;glacier ice alone is&nbsp;very dangerous.

<p>37. There are ample opportunities for wildlife watching if&nbsp;you&rsquo;re into that. Birdwatching especially; 
Finnmark islands supposedly contain huge colonies of&nbsp;sea birds. I&rsquo;ve already mentioned whale watching trips,
and along these lines, seal watching also exists. Polar bears thankfully do&nbsp;not live in&nbsp;Northern Norway
(although they do&nbsp;in&nbsp;Svalbard), so&nbsp;you cannot go&nbsp;polar bear watching. The local fauna in&nbsp;general should be
exceptionally safe.

<p>38. Northern Norway is&nbsp;also, perhaps somewhat unexpectedly, an&nbsp;interesting place to&nbsp;visit if&nbsp;you&rsquo;re
into the history of&nbsp;WWII. Northern Norway, occupied by&nbsp;Nazi Germany in&nbsp;WWII, was important most of&nbsp;all
as&nbsp;a&nbsp;base for interception of&nbsp;lend-lease convoys, bringing American and British aid to&nbsp;the Soviet 
Barentz Sea port of&nbsp;Murmansk. There often are some debates in&nbsp;Russia about the significance of&nbsp;this aid;
the most common consensus&nbsp;is, we&nbsp;would have probable won even without&nbsp;it, but at&nbsp;a&nbsp;much much worse cost than
we&nbsp;did, and the cost we&nbsp;did win at&nbsp;was very terrible to&nbsp;begin with.

<i>Destroyed German fortifications near Kibergneset Cape on&nbsp;Varanger Peninsula</i></p>

<p>39. Some sea-facing mountains were literally hollowed out and covered with
huge artillery cannons. It&nbsp;was supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;the Atlantic Wall, Hitler&rsquo;s huge fortification
project, meant to&nbsp;shield his empire from the sea over its entire length, from Spain to&nbsp;Norway.
The scale of&nbsp;this construction, carried out mostly by&nbsp;prisoners of&nbsp;war, just boggles the mind
(I&nbsp;had no&nbsp;idea about these fortifications before
I&nbsp;first saw them). You can still see numerous caves and bunkers to&nbsp;that day, and can&rsquo;t help but wonder 
if&nbsp;something undiscovered still remains in&nbsp;one of&nbsp;them. Some secret Nazi laboratory with Hitler clones,

<i>Monument at&nbsp;the place of&nbsp;sinking of&nbsp;Battleship Tirpitz on&nbsp;H&aring;koya Island near Troms&oslash;</i></p>

<p>40. The best known episode of&nbsp;war in&nbsp;the Nothern Norway is&nbsp;the raids&nbsp;on, and the sinking of
German Battleship Tirpitz. One of&nbsp;the two largest battleships of&nbsp;Nazi Germany, after its sister ship
Bismarck was sunk by&nbsp;the British in&nbsp;1940 in&nbsp;the Battle of&nbsp;the Atlantic, it&nbsp;was assigned to&nbsp;Norway
for the rest of&nbsp;the war, where it&nbsp;did pretty much nothing (apart from one raid on&nbsp;Svalbard, which was 
a&nbsp;massive overkill), but its mere presence affected the lend-lease convoys a&nbsp;lot&nbsp;&mdash; if&nbsp;Tirpitz 
ever intercepted one, the fight would have been very short. The British made multiple daring attacks
on&nbsp;the Tirpitz, with bombers and midget submarines, and while they severely damaged it&nbsp;several times, it&nbsp;took
many attempts before it&nbsp;was finally sunk by&nbsp;bombers near H&aring;koya Island, close to&nbsp;Troms&oslash;. The monument 
at&nbsp;H&aring;koya is&nbsp;rather small, but there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;whole museum about Tirpitz in&nbsp;K&aring;fjord, Alta, where its previous
base had been.

<p>41. On&nbsp;a&nbsp;lighter (hopefully) note, Northern Norway was commonly used as&nbsp;a&nbsp;base for polar exploration
due&nbsp;to, well, being relatively close to&nbsp;the North Pole. Judging by&nbsp;the monuments and the museums,
Fridtjof Nansen and Roald Amundsen must be&nbsp;pretty popular here, although their best known expeditions weren&rsquo;t
actually related to&nbsp;the Northern Norway.</p>

<i>Exhibitions in&nbsp;Arctic Museum in&nbsp;Troms&oslash;</i></p>

<p>42. The last flight of&nbsp;Amundsen (the first man at&nbsp;the South Pole) took place in&nbsp;1928, when he&nbsp;took off 
from Troms&oslash; on&nbsp;a&nbsp;hydroplane, on&nbsp;a&nbsp;rescue mission to&nbsp;find his former companion, Umberto Nobile, whose
airship Italia has crashed in&nbsp;the Arctic. Nobile&rsquo;s expedition was eventually found, while Amundsen
disappeared without trace.

<i>Route E6&nbsp;between Kirkenes and Varangerbotn</i></p>

<p>43. Okay, so, suppose you want to&nbsp;go&nbsp;there and see all these wonderful things, how would you go&nbsp;about&nbsp;it?
Well, it&nbsp;my&nbsp;opinion the only practical mode of&nbsp;travel is&nbsp;car. Yes, it&rsquo;s a&nbsp;long drive, and you probably
might want to&nbsp;go&nbsp;there by&nbsp;plane and then rent a&nbsp;car in&nbsp;airport. </p>

<p>Many of&nbsp;the smaller towns in&nbsp;Northern Norway have airports, due to&nbsp;the fact that road distances are
considerable. They are however only connected to&nbsp;Troms&oslash;, or&nbsp;Bod&oslash; (in&nbsp;Nordland). Therefore unless
you really want to&nbsp;visit only one specific location, it&nbsp;would probably be&nbsp;easier to&nbsp;just fly to&nbsp;Troms&oslash;,
get a&nbsp;car, and drive on&nbsp;from there. Even with Troms&oslash; as&nbsp;a&nbsp;final destination, you&rsquo;ll probably have to&nbsp;make 
at&nbsp;least one transfer in&nbsp;Oslo; it&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t have many connections to&nbsp;any major airports.</p>

<p>Alternately, you might want to&nbsp;consider renting a&nbsp;car in&nbsp;Finnish Lapland, most likely Rovaniemi.
Rovaniemi is&nbsp;easily reachable via Helsinki by&nbsp;plane or&nbsp;train, and car rental prices in&nbsp;Finland will likely
be&nbsp;significantly lower. I&nbsp;won&rsquo;t quote any specific numbers, just go&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.sixt.com/">Sixt</a>
or&nbsp;any other major rental company website. You&rsquo;re looking at&nbsp;a &gt;500&nbsp;km drive from Rovaniemi to&nbsp;Norway,
but driving through Lapland is&nbsp;generally easy and pleasant.</p> 

<p>If&nbsp;you actually decide to&nbsp;drive your own car from the direction of&nbsp;Sweden, continental Europe, or&nbsp;even
Southern or&nbsp;Western Norway, your best bet is&nbsp;European Route E4&nbsp;via Sweden, and then possibly
via Finnish roads.
The backbone road of&nbsp;Norway itself, European Route&nbsp;E6, is&nbsp;certainly way more scenic but very slow, with many
narrow and/or winding sections. In&nbsp;one place (where entire mainland Norway narrows to&nbsp;an&nbsp;isthmus
6&nbsp;km wide) there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;mandatory ferry crossing.</p>

<p>The E6&nbsp;continues from the Swedish border, through
Oslo and Trondheim and Narvik, to&nbsp;the Northern Norway, ending in&nbsp;Kirkenes, very close to&nbsp;the Russian border.
Its better parts (like the one pictured above) are actually quite nice, and the traffic is&nbsp;light.
Nearly all other roads in&nbsp;the Northern Norway branch from the&nbsp;E6; there are only a&nbsp;few sections with 
alternate routes, notably Finnmark County Road 98&nbsp;on Lakselv-Tana Bru leg (more coastal and scenic than the E6
that goes through Finnmarksvidda Plateau), and ferry connections through Lyngenfjorden and Ullsfjorden
forming Troms County Road 91&nbsp;that allows to&nbsp;cut down travel time and distance in&nbsp;Lyngen area very considerably.</p>

<p>As&nbsp;for &ldquo;driving from Russia or&nbsp;Southern Finland&rdquo; case, that&rsquo;s the one&nbsp;I have personal experience with, and
I&rsquo;ll tell about those roads in&nbsp;more detail in&nbsp;the coming posts. Suffice to&nbsp;say, the roads in&nbsp;Finland are very good
and in&nbsp;Russia good enough too, but expect two or&nbsp;three full days on&nbsp;the road, if&nbsp;you&rsquo;re going from St. Petersburg
or&nbsp;Helsinki.</p> 


<p><a id="44" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8086/28720546705_f0ebb6e593_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8086/28720546705_92aacee66e_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8086/28720546705_05a9a881d9_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="44" title="Hamningberg Road" class="img-thumbnail"></a> <br>
<i>Hamningberg Road (Finnmark County Road 341), one of&nbsp;the Norwegian National Tourist Routes</i></p>

<p>44. The quality of&nbsp;secondary roads may vary. Some roads may be&nbsp;curvy and narrow, sometimes too narrow for two cars
to&nbsp;pass, requiring one of&nbsp;them to&nbsp;wait in&nbsp;a&nbsp;passing place or&nbsp;to&nbsp;move over to&nbsp;gravel shoulder. Hamningberg Road,
pictured above, is&nbsp;an&nbsp;extreme example of&nbsp;such a&nbsp;road, with only one lane. While trucks are rare, there are usually
lots of&nbsp;slow motorhomes, which can get very annoying at&nbsp;times. Overtaking anyone on&nbsp;a&nbsp;narrow road (with no&nbsp;centerline)
without warning is&nbsp;a&nbsp;very bad idea. On&nbsp;straight stretches of&nbsp;such a&nbsp;road, trucks and motorhomes will often shift to
the right as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;possible, and signal with their right blinker &ldquo;it&rsquo;s okay to&nbsp;overtake&rdquo;. Of&nbsp;course this still requires
some width; on&nbsp;a&nbsp;road as&nbsp;narrow as&nbsp;Hamningberg Road overtaking is&nbsp;only really possible if&nbsp;the vehicle ahead stops and pulls
over entirely.</p>

<p>Most if&nbsp;not all &ldquo;official&rdquo; roads
are paved; while the paving may be&nbsp;worn out on&nbsp;smaller roads, I&nbsp;have never seen any actual potholes. There are occasional
gravel and dirt roads going to&nbsp;the mountains, usually marked on&nbsp;a&nbsp;topographic map. Attempting these roads on&nbsp;a&nbsp;regular
car is&nbsp;also a&nbsp;bad idea. There are exceptions though, such as&nbsp;Beskades Road. </p>

<p>Many minor roads close down for winter entirely (a&nbsp;boom will be&nbsp;lowered). Even sections of&nbsp;trunk roads
going over mountain passes or&nbsp;plateaus have to&nbsp;employ convoy driving; basically, the road is&nbsp;normally closed,
but a&nbsp;snowplow goes through according to&nbsp;a&nbsp;timetable, and the other traffic may follow&nbsp;it. Most notably, Route E69
(the road to&nbsp;the North Cape) uses convoy driving on&nbsp;its tundra sections. Sometimes there are electronic
signs informing about the conditions on&nbsp;the mountain pass ahead. In&nbsp;general, winter driving in&nbsp;Northern Norway
is&nbsp;a&nbsp;topic on&nbsp;its own, and&nbsp;I cannot really tell much about&nbsp;it, having never attempted it&nbsp;myself so&nbsp;far.</p>

<i>Hamningberg Road (Finnmark County Road 341), one of&nbsp;the Norwegian National Tourist Routes</i></p>

<p>45. Of&nbsp;course many of&nbsp;the minor roads are actually the prettiest ones! Hamningberg Road (and the preceding
Route E75 over Varanger Peninsula), Hav&oslash;ysund Road, and Senja Coastal Road are actually designated as
National Tourist Routes, and are maintained well, with cool rest areas. There are however many lesser known
scenic routes as&nbsp;well, such as&nbsp;the aforementioned Beskades Road (an&nbsp;old gravel road through a&nbsp;vast mountain plateau,
covered with tundra, at&nbsp;500-600&nbsp;m elevation). 
</p>

<p><a id="46" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8832/28103043494_a5321fea3c_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8832/28103043494_d68817754b_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8832/28103043494_b95b4f3a86_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="46" title="Ullsfjorden Ferry" class="img-thumbnail"></a> <br>
<i>On&nbsp;a&nbsp;road ferry over Ullsfjorden</i></p>

<p>46. There are many island communities in&nbsp;Northern Norway, and most of&nbsp;them are connected to&nbsp;the mainland only
by&nbsp;ferries. Additionally, there are some ferries over fjords, which just allow to&nbsp;cut down on&nbsp;travel time.
Unlike Finland or&nbsp;Sweden, Norwegian ferries are not free, and the price in&nbsp;fact can be&nbsp;quite significant.
I&nbsp;don&rsquo;t think there is&nbsp;any central website with all ferry timetables, so&nbsp;you generally have
to&nbsp;Google them individually. At&nbsp;least you don&rsquo;t have to&nbsp;make any bookings; just drive onto the ferry, and 
a&nbsp;fare collector will come up&nbsp;to&nbsp;you and sell you a&nbsp;ticket. As&nbsp;ferry distances aren&rsquo;t usually particularly
short, the ferries should generally have a&nbsp;common cabin, bathrooms, and likely a&nbsp;cafeteria. 
</p>

<p><a id="47" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8266/28614927032_8647339f52_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8266/28614927032_18297a00f1_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8266/28614927032_58a4fdc47c_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="47" title="Vardø Tunnel" class="img-thumbnail"></a> <br>
<i>Vard&oslash; underwater tunnel</i></p>

<p>47. Some islands however (like Mager&oslash;ya or&nbsp;Vard&oslash;) are connected to&nbsp;the mainlaind by&nbsp;underwater tunnels,
sometimes many kilometers long. Tunnels may also be&nbsp;constructed under mountains, or&nbsp;along mountain slope
for avalanche protection. Tunnels are often dark, narrow, steep, or&nbsp;wet, so&nbsp;you should drive very carefully in&nbsp;them. 
</p>

<p>There are many toll roads and tunnels in&nbsp;Norway; Norway in&nbsp;general isn&rsquo;t shy when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;making money
off car users (which is&nbsp;actually surprising, considering the size of&nbsp;the country; I&nbsp;can understand
when Denmark does this, but much of&nbsp;Norway is&nbsp;nearly inaccessible without a&nbsp;car). In&nbsp;Northern Norway however
toll roads are extremely rare (there simply isn&rsquo;t enough traffic volume to&nbsp;bother). The only toll road
in&nbsp;all of&nbsp;Troms and Finnmark currently is&nbsp;Rya Tunnel in&nbsp;the vicinity of&nbsp;Troms&oslash; (100&nbsp;NOK cost, about &euro;11.5), not an&nbsp;essential road connection 
by&nbsp;any means. You may find travel guides claiming that Mager&oslash;ya Tunnel is&nbsp;tolled; this isn&rsquo;t true anymore,
the toll period on&nbsp;that tunnel has expired. Toll payment is&nbsp;entirely electronic; you have to&nbsp;register
on&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.autopass.no/en/visitors-payment">AutoPASS</a> website either in&nbsp;advance
or&nbsp;shortly after your trip, and pay an&nbsp;invoice when it&nbsp;arrives via email (which may take several months).</p>

<i>Hurtigruten moored in&nbsp;Honningsv&aring;g</i></p>

<p>48. Apart from the smaller ferries, there is&nbsp;one giant ferry which connects all of&nbsp;the important
Norwegian ports, from Bergen to&nbsp;Kirkenes: the Hurtigruten, &ldquo;Coastal Route&rdquo;. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;very old route,
and its actual use as&nbsp;a&nbsp;mode of&nbsp;transport has declined since there are now roads to&nbsp;all of&nbsp;its ports,
and airports in&nbsp;many of&nbsp;them too. It&rsquo;s more of&nbsp;a&nbsp;cruise ship now, but you still can use it&nbsp;to&nbsp;e.g. avoid long
travel around all the fjords. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hurtigruten.com/">See for yourself</a>
(Norway Port to&nbsp;Port option);
a&nbsp;complete journey from Bergen to&nbsp;Kirkenes costs a&nbsp;fortune, but&nbsp;e.&nbsp;g. Honningsv&aring;g to&nbsp;Kj&oslash;llefjord
might end up&nbsp;fairly reasonable. I&nbsp;haven&rsquo;t used Hurtigruten myself, though. </p>

<p><a id="49" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8854/28103261964_dbc0ebd57c_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8854/28103261964_24a24ae681_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8854/28103261964_803064b5d5_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="49" title="Hurtigruten" class="img-thumbnail"></a> <br>
<i>Hurtigruten approaching Vard&oslash;</i></p>

<p>49. Hurtigruten ships, in&nbsp;their distinctive black, red, and white livery, are a&nbsp;common sight in&nbsp;these towns,
and you&rsquo;re likely to&nbsp;see them several times. Honningsv&aring;g (the town closest to&nbsp;the North Cape) in&nbsp;particular 
becomes many times noisier when all the cruise passengers disembark at&nbsp;once.
</p>

<p>Oh yeah, about the buses.  I don't actually know anything about the buses, but I suppose there are
    some long-distance coaches.   I doubt they are particularly frequent or convenient.  In general,
    if own/rental car is not an option, I guess you could try hitchhiking.  Coaches just seem like a masochistic choice.</p>

<p><a id="50" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8280/28642924241_ac5e2817cb_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8280/28642924241_f10b71a7b3_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8280/28642924241_6a63da416a_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="50" title="This Postcard Was the Only Thing I Could Afford in Norway" class="img-thumbnail"></a></p>

<p>50. One final tip. NORWAY IS&nbsp;EXPENSIVE! Really really expensive! I&nbsp;mean Finland or&nbsp;Sweden might be&nbsp;pretty 
expensive too, and Denmark is&nbsp;worse, but Norway is&nbsp;really the priciest of&nbsp;them all. Norwegians themselves
generally have proportionally higher salaries so&nbsp;that&rsquo;s not as&nbsp;big an&nbsp;issue for them, but as&nbsp;a&nbsp;traveller,
you are bound to&nbsp;suffer.</p>

<p>Actually it&nbsp;was not quite as&nbsp;terrible as&nbsp;we&nbsp;expected. Grocery, gas, and accomodation prices are comparable
to&nbsp;Finland, generally only slightly more expensive. What is&nbsp;really bad is&nbsp;restaurant prices. Never ever
eat out in&nbsp;Norway unless that&rsquo;s a&nbsp;life or&nbsp;death question, or&nbsp;you&rsquo;re some kind of&nbsp;super rich Arab oil sheikh!
Even a&nbsp;puny hotdog at&nbsp;a&nbsp;gas station may cost as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;a&nbsp;complete meal in&nbsp;Finland. Various tourist activities
(whale-watching and the like) might also be&nbsp;more expensive then you expect. We&nbsp;self-catered, staying mostly
in&nbsp;hostels and AirBnBs, and only visited some museums (these are usually okay), and in&nbsp;the end ended up&nbsp;almost within 
our projected budget. (Of&nbsp;course we&nbsp;had some extra in&nbsp;case of&nbsp;some emergency, but thankfully everything went 
according to&nbsp;our plan.)</p>
