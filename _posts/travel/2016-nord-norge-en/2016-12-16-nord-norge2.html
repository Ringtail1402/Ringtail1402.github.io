<p>Let's start with a short overview of our entire trip.  Well, since the trip lasted 16 days, this is actually
    not a short overview at all, but at least it fits on one page.</p>

<h4>Day 1: Leaving St. Petersburg.  Beginning of Kola Route.  Petrozavodsk</h4>

<p><a id="1" href="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7616/28105289103_a6d2e7457e_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7616/28105289103_d732c09832_c.jpg 1x, https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7616/28105289103_fa03a32a5e_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="1" title="Beginning of Kola Route" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>
<i>Kola Route (Russian Federal Route R-21) begins at an interchange with St. Petersburg Ring Motorway</i></p>

<p>1. I got up early in the morning, got all my stuff into the car, picked up my friend, and we had breakfast
    at a cafe in the center of St. Petersburg.  Then we began a 420 km drive to Petrozavodsk, on Kola Route.
</p>

<p><b>Kola Route</b> (<i>трасса "Кола"</i>; Federal Route R-21, more often signposted as M-18, and also commonly 
    referred to as Murmansk Highway) is the main road to Russian Karelia and to the Kola
    Peninsula.  Pretty much the only road, actually (unless you go through Finland).  It starts in the southeast
    of St. Petersburg, and initially goes to the east, then curves to the north around Ladoga Lake.  
    The road is nice enough as far as Russian roads go, and once you pass the turnoff
    towards Vologda, the traffic becomes relatively light.  It looks fairly bland, just a highway through an
    endless forest, but livens up a bit in Karelia; you begin to see denser woods, some mires, and sometimes 
    some rocky outcroppings (the latter are nowhere as common as in Finnish Karelia though).</p>

<p>The section just outside St. Petersburg is known to be very heavily congested on Saturday mornings in summer, due to everyone driving to their
    <i>dachas</i>, and I expected to spend hours in traffic jams.  Suprisingly there were none; it appears
    we managed to set out early enough in the morning to avoid these.  So by midday we were in Petrozavodsk already.</p>

<p><a id="2" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8595/28643239011_c9ba22997d_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8595/28643239011_32373162c1_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8595/28643239011_0ea07a9c40_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="2" title="Onega Lake waterfront" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>
<i>Fishermen scuplture at the Onega Lake waterfront in Petrozavodsk, Russian Karelia</i></p>

<p>2. We spent most of the rest of the day exploring <b>Petrozavodsk</b> <i>(Петрозаводск)</i>.  It's a city of some 300 thousand;
its name means "Peter's Works Town", as it was established by Peter the Great as a metalworking factory.
I'm not sure why it became the capital of the whole vast Russian Karelia ("Republic of Karelia") region.
There is hardly anything particularly Karelian about it, apart from some streets named after Karelian and Finnish
communists.  
</p>

<p>Petrozavodsk is located at a beautiful place, on the shore of Onega Lake <i>(Онежское озеро)</i>, the second huge lake of Russian Northwest,
    after Ladoga Lake.  The waterfront appears to have been recently renovated (borrowing some ideas
    from common Finnish town decorations, I believe), and it shows.</p>

<p><a id="3" href="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7666/28105254713_f38ebf8033_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7666/28105254713_255ec0a36d_c.jpg 1x, https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7666/28105254713_d90266164d_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="3" title="Petrozavodsk neighborhood" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>
<i>Zareka ("Beyoud-the-River") neighborhood in Petrozavodsk, Russian Karelia</i></p>

<p>3. Most of the rest of the city appears very dilapidated and underfunded.  This is sadly pretty
    much expected for a Russian city of that size.  Despite this, I found myself oddly attracted to Petrozavodsk.
    It certainly has its own character (even if it's not very Karelian), and it doesn't really seem depressing.
    I particularly liked people in the streets.  It's hard to describe, and it certainly might be due to my
    own perceptions and history, but whenever I visit my hometown of Yekaterinburg, it always looks to me as if 
    it's populated mostly by alcoholics; on the other hand, people in Petrozavodsk look just like they do 
    in St. Petersburg.
</p>

<p>A funny thing about Petrozavodsk (and about most of other smaller Russian cities I suppose) is that 
    it's significantly cheaper than in St. Petersburg.  And if you're used to Finnish prices, and trying to mentally prepare
    yourself for Norwegian prices, everything in Petrozavodsk seems just dirt cheap.  We lived in what is probably
    the best hotel in town, yet it felt very affordable for us.</p>

<h4>Day 2: Petrozavodsk to Murmansk.  Kandalaksha.  Evening Murmansk</h4>

<p><a id="4" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8238/28436451460_1f6f2358aa_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8238/28436451460_6cfed0122e_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8238/28436451460_b57c826669_h.jpg 2x" width="534" height="800" alt="4" title="Arctic Circle sign" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>
<i>Arctic Circle sign at the Kola Route, somewhere near the border of Russian Karelia and Murmansk Oblast</i></p>

<p>4. The distance between Petrozavodsk and Murmansk is 930 km, and we intended to cover it on that day.  So we
    set out fairly early and didn't do much sightseeing.
</p>

<p>There is hardly anything to the north of Medvezhyegorsk (not far from Petrozavodsk) in the entire Russian Karelia.  Well, there are some 
    towns like Kostomuskha (not to be confused with Kandalaksha), but all of them are located pretty far from the Kola 
    Route itself.  Due to the length of Petrozavodsk-Murmansk drive and the lack of gas stations and overall civilization,
    you have to plan your refuelings in advance (this is the only time we needed to do that on our trip).  There are in
    particular <i>no</i> gas stations on the entire Pushnoi-Zelenogorski leg (over 300 km), so we had to refuel near Pushnoi
    <i>(Пушной; Russ. Fur Village)</i>, waiting in a long queue.</p>

<p>The traffic remains light, but there are lots and lots of semis, so you'd better get used to overtaking.
    The road is 1+1 lane of course, but it's mostly very straight, so there's nothing dangerous. 
    Although we drove through sudden huge rainstorms twice on that day, and driving between two semis 
    in a rainstorm is a bit scary.</p>

<p>At about the same place Karelia changes into Murmansk Oblast <i>(Мурманская область; Russ. Murmansk Region)</i>,
there's an "Arctic Circle" sign.  For the next two weeks, we remained above the Arctic Circle, in the midnight sun zone.
So we didn't see any proper night for quite some time after Petrozavodsk.</p>

<p><a id="5" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8613/28615010602_954b76ea11_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8613/28615010602_d02b0e6d4e_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8613/28615010602_10abdd6df7_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="5" title="White Sea in Kandalaksha" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>
<i>Fishing sheds at the White Sea in Kandalaksha, Murmansk Oblast</i></p>

<p>5. Murmansk Oblast definitely feels more populated than Russian Karelia, or at least the part of it along the Kola Route does.
    (In fact most of the Kola Peninsula is all but uninhabited; Murmansk and the Kola Route are not located on the 
    peninsula proper.) </p>

<p>Of the towns on our way (Polyarnye Zori, Kandalaksha, Monchegorsk) we chose to drop by in <b>Kandalaksha</b> <i>(Кандалакша)</i>, to refuel again
    and to have something to eat.  Kandalaksha is an old town of 33,000, not very exciting but not a hellhole either.
    We had some cheap microwaved food at some random restaurant, and refueled at a StatOil gas station.  Murmansk Oblast seems
    to have a fairly good coverage of those, probably due to proximity to Norway (StatOil is the Norwegian state oil company).</p>

<p>Kandalaksha is also a seaport on the White Sea, and of course we tried to have a peek at the sea, which neither of us
    had ever seen before, or was likely to see any time soon again.  This wasn't an easy task; the whole city is almost 
    entirely cut off from the sea by railroads, cargo seaport, and other industrial areas.  In the end we found a small unmarked
    dirt road to a local beach, and finally managed to glimpse a tiny bay of the White Sea.</p>

<p><a id="6" href="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7794/28615003622_5674dfdd20_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7794/28615003622_91154bbf97_c.jpg 1x, https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7794/28615003622_65bceaf1b1_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="6" title="Kola Route in Murmansk Oblast" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>
<i>Kola Route in Murmansk Oblast</i></p>

<p>6. The Kola Route in Murmansk Oblast becomes much more scenic, to the degree I declared it the prettiest road 
    I had seen so far (the title was later surpassed on the very same trip by many Norwegian roads, of course).
    Geographically, Murmansk Oblast and Kola Peninsula are pretty much the extensions of Lapland region, and they feature
    the same majestic treeless fells.  These include Khibiny Mountains, a very popular hiking and skiing destination.
    The fells are actually on average taller there than in Finnish Lapland, I believe.  
    The road has some steep gradients, but it remains very straight, and nearly all the uphill sections have an
    extra climbing lane.  All in all, a very pleasant driving experience.
</p>

<p><a id="7" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8435/28688106696_6bccde455b_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8435/28688106696_240cd22506_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8435/28688106696_408f5756fc_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="7" title="Midnight sun in Murmansk" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>
<i>Midnight sun (11 PM actually) in Murmansk</i></p>

<p>7. We arrived to Murmansk at about 9 PM, and, after checking into a hotel (a small one, on the first floor
of an apartment block on the outskirts of the city) we decided to have a short walk, and saw our first midnight sun.</p>

<p><b>Murmansk</b> <i>(Мурманск,
Russ. Murman Town, "Murman" being an old word for "Norwegian")</i> is the largest city above the Arctic Circle in the world,
with the population of about 300,000.  It is built pretty much around a huge seaport on the Barentz Sea
(or actually on the Kola Bay, a 57 km long fjord, although not known as such).  The city is fairly young,
founded just before the Russian Revolution, and lacks major sights.  However it looks very developed for its size,
certainly in a much better shape than similarly-sized Petrozavodsk.  Perhaps this is due to the fact that the bases
of the Russian Northern Fleet are located in its suburbs (which you cannot easily visit, these are closed cities),
and our Northern Fleet is the most important one, as it's the one with most of the nuclear subs.
</p>

<h4>Day 3: Murmansk.  Pechenga and Zapolyarny.  Norwegian Border.  Pasvikdalen</h4>

<p><a id="8" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8849/28643101361_fd663cb3c0_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8849/28643101361_0f61681d50_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8849/28643101361_0e1e7146cd_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="8" title="Kola Bay" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>
<i>Kola Bay and Murmansk apartment blocks, as seen from the base of the "Alyosha" statue</i></p>

<p>8. We spent about half of the following day exploring Murmansk.  We liked it but there's not that much
    to show.  I ate a cheeseburger at the northernmost McDonald's in the world (pretty much by accident),
    my friend exchanged some rubles for Norwegian krones (which turned out to be entirely unnecessary as 
    we were able to pay by card everywhere), and we dropped into an Okay supermarket (which looked exactly
    like Okay supermarkets in St. Petersburg -- "Okay" is the name of the chain) for some final grocery shopping before the Norwegian border.
</p>

<p><a id="9" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8801/28102919484_1592da0ff5_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8801/28102919484_b010689aff_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8801/28102919484_999db6fb8a_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="9" title="Kola Route after Murmansk" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>
<i>Kola Route between Murmansk and Pechenga</i></p>

<p>9. Beyond Murmansk, the Kola Route turns to the west, parallel to the sea coast, and there are 
    some 200 km more of it.  It becomes more curvy here, but the traffic drops to nearly zero to compensate for it.
    The landscape becomes tundra-like although not entirely treeless.</p>

<p>There are a few small towns between Murmansk and the Norwegian border: Pechenga, Sputnik,
    Nikel, and Zapolyarny.  We had a very brief look at <b>Pechenga</b> <i>(Печенга)</i>; it's an old town, but it's barely more than
    a military base nowadays.  It looks thoroughly miserable.  
</p>

<p>At the insistence of my friend we stopped at <b>Zapolyarny</b> <i>(Заполярный, Russ. Beyond-the-Arctic)</i>
to eat, and I hated every minute of it.  Zapolyarny and the nearby Nikel are built next to nickel mines
and smelting plants.  Zapolyarny (pop. 15,000)
is scarcely more than a collection of ugly Soviet apartment blocks, and the people there look nasty.
I was actually afraid we would get mugged or someone would break into our car.  I'm likely exagerrating,
that's just the impression I've got.</p>

<p>Anyway we had our last dinner in Russia, and drove on for the final kilometers of the Kola Route.  
    Which after Zapolyarny first gets very straight, and then turns into a construction area where 
    you have to drive on top of broken stone for ten or fifteen kilometers.  Presumably the road 
    adjacent to the border is being rebuilt.</p>

<p>The sole border crossing between Russia and Norway is called <b>Boris Gleb</b> <i>(Борисоглебск, after
    St. Boris and St. Gleb, Russian saints)</i> on the Russian side, and <b>Storskog</b> <i>(Norw. Big Forest)</i>
    on the Norwegian side.  It looks very quiet and peaceful, and both Russian and Norwegian personnel
    were extremely friendly.  Our car was the only one at the crossing, and we got some rare stamps in our
    passports without any difficulties.</p>

<p><a id="10" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8775/28643075221_73d116307b_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8775/28643075221_048830238f_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8775/28643075221_0143a0e047_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="10" title="Långfjord in Pasvikdalen" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>
<i>Långfjord in Pasvikdalen area</i></p>

<p>10. A large fraction of the Norwegian-Russian border follows the Pasvikelva <i>(Paz, Паз, in Russian)</i>
    river.  Norwegian side of Pasvikelva valley (<b>Pasvikdalen</b>) forms a 150 km long wedge between
    Finnish and Russian territory.  Its landscapes are more similar to Finnish Lapland lowlands 
    (basically just vast pine and fir forests), rather tame by Norwegian standards.  But in any case 
    our first place of overnight stay was in Pasvikdalen, in Melkefoss <i>(Norw. Milk Waterfall)</i> village near the eponymous
    hydro power station, in a nice small cottage.  We had to drive 60 km kilometers into Pasvikdalen,
    but at least we got to see a (tiny) fjord on our way.
</p>

<p><a id="11" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8691/28688078726_26dbb5868a_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8691/28688078726_afb4ce0d17_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8691/28688078726_afd536f746_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="11" title="At Melkefoss" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>
<i>At the Melkefoss campsite</i></p>

<p>11. The place was advertised as B&amp;B (Birk Husky -- they actually specialize in dog sledge tours),
    but the accomodation was more like a typical Finnish camping, with a small hut which had electricity
    and a small kitchen, but no bathroom.  Pasvikelva river was just a short walk away.</p>
    
<p>The cottage would have been perfect if not for mosquitoes!  We were aware that mosquitoes get
    extremely nasty in the northern summer, and we had a plug-in mosquito repellent with us which helped 
    us sleep.  However that meant we had to keep windows almost shut, and we got up with some bad
    headache in the morning.
</p>

<h4>Day 4: Grense Jakobselv.  Neiden and Näätämö.  Varangerfjorden.  Vadsø</h4>

<p><a id="12" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8857/28643069571_1a859ebd49_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8857/28643069571_236bab8325_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8857/28643069571_613fe30615_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="12" title="Near the road to Grense Jakobselv" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>
<i>At a mountain plateau near Vintervollvatnet Lake, by the road to Grense Jakobselv village</i>
</p>

<p>12. That was one busy day.  After an aborted (due to rain) attempt to visit Melkefoss power station
    on foot, we drove out all the way back to the border crossing, and right before the border crossing 
    we turned onto a narrow road leading through a low mountain plateau to Grense Jakobselv village.
    That plateau was our first taste of Arctic landscapes, and the first place we got to see reindeer (spoiler:
    not in the picture above, don't bother to look).
    </p>

<p><a id="13" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8456/28643065721_53387401c0_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8456/28643065721_e81fb110db_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8456/28643065721_50fd82ed22_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="13" title="King Oscar II Chapel" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>
<i>King Oscar II Chapel at Grense Jakobselv</i></p>

<p>13. <b>Grense Jakobselv</b> means "Jakobselv river border", and it's the name of the village located
at the very end of Norwegian-Russian border, where it meets the Barentz Sea, and the Arctic Ocean.
That was the first place we got to see open ocean.  The village itself is tiny, but it has a very cool sight,
a stunningly beautiful chapel, built in the middle of nowhere pretty much specifically to mark the border.
I've never seen any construction which looks as much right out of a fantasy movie as this chapel does.</p>

<p><a id="14" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8349/28436372820_010e2873eb_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8349/28436372820_773b59bb32_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8349/28436372820_f9a89b8b51_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="14" title="On the E6 road" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>
<i>Car after driving on the road to Grense Jakobselv in wet weather, on the Route E6 near Kirkenes</i></p>

<p>14. After getting back from Grense Jakobselv we didn't stop at Kirkenes, the border town, instead
    just driving on onto <b>Route E6</b>, the main road of Norway.  It's amazing how dirty a car can get
    from driving just 20 km on a gravel road (most of the Grense Jakobselv road is paved but the final section is not)
    in rain.  </p>

<p><a id="15" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8688/28436371860_c42739c73b_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8688/28436371860_1f2e478feb_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8688/28436371860_42c8865986_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="15" title="Varangerfjorden" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>
<i>Varangerfjorden arm behind Skogerøya Island</i></p>

<p>15. Soon we got to see the first great fjord of Norway (counting from the northern end), the <b>Varangerfjorden</b>.
    It is vast, 100 km long and 50 km wide at the mouth, but its shores are not very tall or steep.
    Varangerfjorden separates the Varanger Peninsula from the mainland.  This is only a small arm of the fjord,
    blocked by a large uninhabited island named Skogerøya, but there would be more to come.

<i>Skoltefossen waterfall in Neiden village</i></p>

<p>16. <b>Neiden</b> is the only village in Norway where the Skolt Sami live, and we had a brief look at their 
    old houses and chapel.  There is a beautiful waterfall right in the village, appropriately named Skoltefossen.

<i>Reindeer running along Norwegian-Finnish border fence at Neiden</i></p>

<p>17. Finnish territory is a very short drive away from Neiden; in fact the village on the other side, Näätämö,
    is considered an extension of Neiden.  We decided to visit Näätämö for some cheaper grocery shopping (we could not 
    bring everything from Russia in advance as some foods cannot be brought across the border) and fuel. </p>

<i>At Gornitak rest area near Varangerbotn</i></p>

<p>18. In Varangerbotn village we turned to the east, driving onto Varanger Peninsula.  The road here
    (the final section of Route E75) is considered a National Tourist Route, and as such it got some nice
    rest areas in scenic places, like this one called Gornitak (more properly Gorgŋetak, it's a Northern Sami name).

<i>Harbor in the town of Vadsø</i></p>

<p>19. <b>Vadsø</b>, the capital of Finnmark County, is actually pretty tiny.  It's the first town we got to see in Norway, 
    and we walked a bit around it.  Perhaps due to the weather which cleared by that time the town seemed very idyllic.
</p>

<p><a id="20" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8620/28436356140_b57947ae5f_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8620/28436356140_dc83008e53_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8620/28436356140_d4fc4e49d9_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="20" title="Varanger landscape" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>
<i>Varanger landscape closer to Varangerfjorden mouth</i></p>

<p>20. Beyond Vadsø Varanger Peninsula becomes a tundra; any trees cease to appear completely.  It still felt idyllic but the weather
    worsened again very soon, and we drove the last kilometers in a thick fog.  Our destination was Vardø, a tiny town
    on an island at the very end of Varanger (connected to the mainland by a tunnel).  We had an AirBnB apartment booked 
    there for two nights.  As we were pretty tired by that point, we left Vardø exploration for the following day.  </p>

<h4>Day 5: Vardø.  Hamningberg</h4>

<p><a id="21" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8464/28436352440_0c16675173_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8464/28436352440_0737a3da16_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8464/28436352440_b527b4db26_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="21" title="Vardø" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>
<i>The town of Vardø</i></p>

<p>21. Well, <b>Vardø</b> looked completely unlike Vadsø.  A tiny (2,000) town on a tiny Arctic island, completely lacking
    any trees, and inhabited mostly by fishermen it seems.  This place really got character.
      There's hardly anyone in the streets, and the two or three
    tourists we saw looked frozen half to death and miserable.  We explored the town, including both sea-facing cliffs
    and its Rema-1000 supermarket, briefly returning to our apartment to warm ourselves up with some tea.  </p>

<p><a id="22" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8676/28614906642_9e1c2c594e_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8676/28614906642_bb238ef628_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8676/28614906642_340f0fa37b_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="22" title="Vardø witch burnings memorial" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>
<i>Vardø witch burnings memorial</i></p>

<p>22. Vardø has few sights but they're quite memorable.  There's a huge memorial to witch burnings, for example.
    For some reason Vardø citizens were really keen on witch burnings in the 16th century or so (yeah, Vardø's 
    pretty old -- the oldest town in Northern Norway, in fact).  Inside a construction in the background is a long
    dark corridor, with a section devoted to each woman burned at the stake, with a short description of the 
    accusation, and a tiny light, visible from the outside from small windows.</p>

<p><a id="23" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8748/28103222304_553c065b35_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8748/28103222304_185dcfbd81_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8748/28103222304_42472af216_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="23" title="Hamningberg road" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>
<i>Hamningberg Road along the northern coast of Varanger Peninsula</i></p>

<p>23. The road from Vardø tunnel continues on along the northern coast of Varanger, facing the open sea.
    The landscape here is wild and harsh, with endless jagged rocks, and some snow patches occuring right at the sea
    level -- in July.  The road itself (some 35 km long) is very narrow, basically one one lane wide, and passing oncoming traffic
    is always a little adventure in itself (although it's not especially difficult in most places).  This road
    which ends at the tiny village of Hamningberg is officially the most scenic road I've ever driven on.
</p>

<p><a id="24" href="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7785/28642988191_87bdc331e5_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7785/28642988191_534c987a1a_c.jpg 1x, https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7785/28642988191_61ccbb1da6_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="24" title="Mountain over Hamningberg" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>
<i>Destroyed Nazi fortification at the top of Hardbakken Mountain in Hamningberg</i></p>

<p>24. <b>Hamningberg</b> is a small village, only inhabited in summer; supposedly one of the very few
places in Northern Norway which survived the World War II intact.  Truthfully it wasn't all that 
fancy to begin with, though.  We climbed a small mountain named Hardbakken right next to the village,
and were surprised to find the remains of bunkers, pillboxes, and gun mounts.  It turns out Hamningberg
with Hardbakken was one of the many places where the Germans built their sea-facing fortifications during the war.
I had been completely unaware of that.</p>

<p><a id="25" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8347/28720545585_cd61f98106_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8347/28720545585_16eed3841e_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8347/28720545585_e847b73575_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="25" title="Vardø from afar" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>
<i>Vardø and Vardøya Island, as seen from Hamningberg Road</i></p>

<p>25. Going back to Vardø from Hamningberg, you can see Vardø's most obvious landmark clearly:
    a huge white ball-shaped NATO radar installation.
</p>

<h4>Day 6: Kibergneset.  Vardø to Honningsvåg</h4>

<p><a id="26" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8870/28687995536_ec9bbd9309_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8870/28687995536_852a736895_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8870/28687995536_43eac21792_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="26" title="Lighthouse at Kibergneset" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>
<i>Tiny automated lighthouse at Kibergneset Cape</i></p>

<p>26. We planned a 510 km long drive from Vardø to Honningsvåg on this day.  510 km might not sound that out of place,
    but driving 510 km in Norway is usually very different from driving 510 km in Finland or on a very good Russian road 
    like the Kola Route.  Norwegian roads, even the trunk ones, tend to have a lot of slow and narrow sections.  So the only
    place we intended to visit on that day was <b>Kibergneset Cape</b>, a few kilometers south of Vardø tunnel.  Kibergneset is the 
    easternmost point of mainland Norway (the easternmost point of entire Norway is an island next to Vardø).
</p>

<p>We drove about a kilometer uphill on a mountain road from Kiberg village, then got scared of the possibility of 
    damaging car's underside on some rock, left it at a 
    suitable place, and walked the rest of the way on foot.  Saw a great number of Nazi fortifications again, 
    even peeked into one of the huge inviting caves left by them in a mountainside.  Sadly we lacked a suitable light source.</p>

<p>The cape itself, also informally known as Østkapp, is quite easy to reach, on foot or even with a car 
    if you feel brave enough.  There's a standard tiny automated lighthouse there. Similar lighthouses are common
    in Northern Norway.</p>

<p><a id="27" href="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7590/28614877932_0146eb6e0a_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7590/28614877932_42fd650512_c.jpg 1x, https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7590/28614877932_bc411b2eb2_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="27" title="Tana Bru" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>
<i>Tana Bru bridge</i></p>

<p>27. After that we left Varanger Peninsula, driving all the way back through Vadsø and Varangerbotn, and then reached
    the town of Tana Bru.  Tana Bru means "Tana Bridge", and indeed this is the location of the only bridge in Norway that
    crosses Tana River.  Since the river itself flows right from the Finnish border, this bridge is in effect the only
    link to the northeasternmost parts of the country, including Varanger, Kirkenes, and Pasvikdalen.   </p>

<p>By that point we got hungry and had to resort to eating some hot dogs at a gas station.  Even such a simple meal
    is inordinately expensive in Norway.  That's why we (well, my friend actually) mostly cooked ourselves in AirBnB
    apartments and hostel kitchens.  Supermarket prices are also high, but not all that higher than the Finnish ones,
    and we were okay with the Finnish ones.</p>

<p><a id="28" href="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7646/28642965121_124d6b7331_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7646/28642965121_c6b836b01d_c.jpg 1x, https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7646/28642965121_6fd52e9967_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="28" title="Road 98" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>
<i>Finnmark County Road 98 in Ifjordfjellet Mountains</i></p>

<p>28. Instead of driving on Route E6 through Inner Finnmark region, we chose Finnmark County Road 98,
    which provides an alternative to Route E6 on Tana Bru-Lakselv leg.  Road 98 is shorter, but the landscape 
    is much more difficult; it alternately goes along fjord coasts and over mountain passes between fjords.
    But that also means it's the more scenic one, and that's why we chose it.  The road has both very good new sections,
    like this one going through Ifjordfjellet Mountains, and some very poor (narrow and curvy) old ones, although some 
    of the old sections are being rebuilt.  Driving on Road 98, we managed to see (if briefly) three great fjords on that day:
    Tanafjorden, Laksefjorden, and Porsangerfjorden. </p>

<p><a id="29" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8219/28104988473_c2f05e866d_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8219/28104988473_0f52e5735f_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8219/28104988473_4db4d7614f_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="29" title="Route E69 approaching Honningsvåg" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>
<i>Route E69 on Magerøya Island along Porsangerfjorden, approaching Honningsvåg</i></p>

<p>29. In the town of Lakselv we rejoined Route E6, and drove on to the north on the western coast of Porsangerfjorden.
    Our destination was Honningsvåg, a town of 2,500, which is the northernmost town in Norway, and, more importantly,
    the last town before the North Cape.  As such, it serves as a base of sorts for North Cape visits for a lot 
    of tourists.  We had a hostel room booked for two nights there.</p>

<p>At Olderfjord village, Route E69 splits off E6 to go farther north, and along the E69, the landscape rapidly
    gets that "Arctic tundra" look that had gradually disappeared since Varanger.  Then there is an almost 7 km long 
    underwater tunnel to the great Magerøya Island, where Honningsvåg and the North Cape are located.  The rest was easy enough.</p>

<h4>Day 7: Honningsvåg.  North Cape.  Kirkeporten</h4>

<p><a id="30" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8414/28642933831_af8fd6d7b1_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8414/28642933831_12900d3d3f_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8414/28642933831_0ce394158e_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="30" title="Honningsvåg" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>
<i>Honningsvåg harbor</i></p>

<p>30. We started the next day by exploring <b>Honningsvåg</b>.  It's a tiny Arctic fishing town like Vardø, but it has been
    heavily affected by all the tourists passing through it to the North Cape; after all, the North Cape is pretty much
    the best known sight of the entire Northern Norway, while Vardø is very much an out of the way place.  There are 
    many suprisingly big hotels and shops in Honningsvåg (Vardø had only one hotel, and it didn't appear very nice).
    That's not a bad thing of course, it's just different.
</p>

<p><a id="31" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8779/28687941386_f8e286d77c_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8779/28687941386_d7399c1435_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8779/28687941386_1b2bca6e11_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="31" title="North Cape" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>
<i>Globe statue at the North Cape</i></p>

<p>31. <b>The North Cape</b> (Nordkapp) is sort of the northernmost point of Europe.  It's not exactly 100% northernmost,
but it certainly nailed that "end of the world" feel, being a huge cliff over the Barentz Sea.  You can drive all the way
there on Route E69, and there is a museum with a restaurant built there.  The entry is not free, and is actually fairly costly,
although not outrageously so by Norwegian standards.  You may think it's a tourist trap (I don't know of any other places in
Norway which charge money simply to enjoy the view), but it's still worth seeing at least once.  We in particularly enjoyed 
some fun weather at the North Cape, with gale strong enough to rock a parked car and to make the rain fall almost 
horizontally.
</p>

<p><a id="32" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8718/28687924096_c742c48084_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8718/28687924096_3573120ecc_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8718/28687924096_2a05d71278_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="32" title="Kirkeporten Rock" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>
<i>Kirkeporten rock near Skarsvåg villange</i></p>

<p>32. The actual northernmost point of more-or-less contiguous Europe is Knivskjellodden Cape, relatively close to
    the North Cape, sticking 1.5 km farther north.  It looks less dramatic and it's only accessible via several hours 
    long hike.  We really wanted to go to Knivskjellodden too, but decided that the weather was too nasty, and the hour 
    too late.  (That was a correct decision.)  As a compensation, we made a much shorter hike from Skarsvåg village
    (the northernmost settlement of Norway, excluding Svalbard and Jan Mayen Island) over a small mountain to <b>Kirkeporten Rock</b>,
    which is a rock with a hole tall enough to stand inside.  North Cape cliffs are visible from it in the distance.
    That was all for that day.
</p>

<h4>Day 8: Knivskjellodden Cape</h4>

<p><a id="33" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8820/28687918856_bf7c7a1115_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8820/28687918856_dd5b1435af_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8820/28687918856_da10ce4af3_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="33" title="Knivskjellodden Trail" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>
<i>Knivskjellodden trail</i></p>

<p>33. The next day we planned to depart for Alta, possibly visiting Trollholmsundet Rocks on our way.  
    But in the morning we were greeted by perfect sunny weather, and decided to make an attempt for Knivskjellodden
    after all.  
</p>

<p>The trail to <b>Knivskjellodden</b> starts from a parking lot some 5 km from the North Cape, and goes over tundra
    plateaus with occasional small lakes, streams, and reindeer wandering about, before descending from 300 m
    elevation almost to the sea level, where its final stretch goes across a fairly steep rocky slope.
    It's fairly demanding, and it was especially demanding as I for some reason believed it was 7 km long in
    one direction, while it's actually about 9 km -- so a 18 km walk in tundra in total.  Took up about seven
    hours to hike there and back again.</p>

<p><a id="34" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8714/28103116394_0010ee1b19_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8714/28103116394_c21dce8ca2_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8714/28103116394_7102cd1e65_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="34" title="Noodles at Knivskjellodden" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>
<i>Noodles at Knivskjellodden Cape, with a view of the North Cape</i></p>

<p>34. At the cape there is a "northernmost point of Europe" sign and a guestbook but not much else.  Its 
    prettiest part is the view of the neighboring North Cape.  We tried to have some noodles at the 
    northernmost point of Europe but failed to get the water hot enough on my small camping stove,
    probably due to the wind.
</p>

<p>After getting back from Knivskjellodden and some brief grocery shopping in Honningsvåg we were too tired 
    to do anything but drive straight to Alta.  I don't even really remember anything from that 210 km long
    drive.  We were staying in Alta for just one night, and instead of hostels we had a room in a 
    fairly nice hotel booked there.

<h4>Day 9: Alta.  Tirpitz Museum</h4>

<p><a id="35" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8740/28642870211_ac7f2c7174_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8740/28642870211_21fd1953da_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8740/28642870211_4222bc0975_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="35" title="Northern Lights Cathedral" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>
<i>Northern Lights Cathedral in Alta</i></p>

<p>35. <b>Alta</b> is the biggest town in Finnmark County (pop. 20,000), but there's very little to see here.
    Its only sight is its modern-looking Northern Lights Cathedral (not to be confused with the Arctic Cathedral in Tromsø).
    Otherwise it's just a few downtown blocks and huge suburbs, not really much different from any random 
    nondescript small Finnish town.  Even the nature (the Altafjorden coast and the mountains) seems difficult to
    reach from the town.</p>

<p><a id="36" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8884/28720651715_959c88e711_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8884/28720651715_962f01736f_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8884/28720651715_d798282752_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="36" title="Tirpitz Museum" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>
<i>Tirpitz Museum in Kåfjord near Alta</i></p>

<p>36. Kåfjorden is a small arm of the Altafjorden, and in WWII it served as a harbor for the German battleship
    Tirpitz for quite some time.  The British made several raids on Tirpitz; the most daring one used midget
    submarines, which sneaked into the fjord and launched divers who attached explosives to the hull.  Ultimately
    Tirpitz was sunk (by bombers) in another location, at Håkøya Island near Tromsø.  The <b>museum devoted to the Tirpitz</b>
    is still located in Kåfjord village though.  It's small but fairly interesting if you're into that sort of thing.
    It shows a short movie in English telling about the attempts to sunk the battleship, and has a large collection of 
    things raised from the shipwreck.  My dad, who is a fan of WWII naval history, specifically requested me to
    visit this museum. </p>

<p><a id="37" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8631/28720535655_22da29fcf2_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8631/28720535655_3dc705f3a9_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8631/28720535655_00e44d78c4_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="37" title="Kvænangen" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>

<p>37. After the museum we drove on to our next destination, Lyngen Peninsula, a 350 km drive where we finally
    crossed from Finnmark into Troms Country, the second county of Norway from the north.

<i>Driving around Lyngenfjorden, with Lyngen Alps in the background</i></p>

<p>38. The Lyngenfjorden, next
    to the peninsula, is long and relatively narrow and annoying to drive around, so we originally intended to board 
    a ferry over the fjord, which cuts the travel distance by 120 km.  We missed the ferry though, and waiting for the next one 
    would have taken too long, so in the end we just drove around.  At least the views there are great, with jagged and glacier-capped
    Lyngen Alps looking much more imposing than all the Northern Norwegian mountains we had seen before.</p>

<p>We intended to so some hiking in the Lyngen Alps, and so we booked a hostel room in the biggest Lyngen village named Lyngseidet
    for two nights.</p>

<h4>Day 10: Steindalsbreen Glacier in Lyngen Alps</h4>

<p><a id="39" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8791/28687855426_3d609f0711_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8791/28687855426_a9d712d416_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8791/28687855426_a3ab278d8a_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="39" title="Steindalen valley" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>
<i>Steindalen Valley in the Lyngen Alps</i></p>

<p>39. <b>Lyngen Alps</b> (this is the actual name -- Lyngsalpan in Norwegian) are up to about 1800 m high,
and most if not all higher peaks can of course be reached only
    with proper moutaineering equipment and skills.  At the same time, there are many fairly easy hiking trails.  
    We decided to chose one that leads up the Steindalen Valley, along the milky blue Steindalselva glacial river,
    up to 450 m elevation to the edge of <b>Steindalsbreen Glacier</b> <i>(Norw. Stone Valley Glacier)</i>, one of the many Lyngen glaciers.</p>

<p><a id="40" href="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7748/28103064014_6cee5418b3_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7748/28103064014_b29ddd746c_c.jpg 1x, https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7748/28103064014_f9aedd6ffd_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="40" title="Steindalsbreen Glacier" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>
<i>Steindalsbreen Glacier</i></p>

<p>40. The climb was indeed not very difficult (compared to Knivskjellodden trail, for example), but by the time
    we reached the glacier, it was raining heavily, and we were beginning to get drenched.  So we didn't spend much time 
    at the glacier (in particularly we didn't try to walk close enough to touch it), and just got back and called it a day.
    Still, that was the first time any of us saw an actual glacier up close, and that was quite memorable.
</p>

<h4>Day 11: Blåvatnet Lake in Lyngen Alps.  Some Tromsø</h4>

<p><a id="41" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8618/28104778483_7ff97f235f_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8618/28104778483_4bcce534d2_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8618/28104778483_24e093c2c0_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="41" title="Blåvatnet lake trail" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>
<i>Beginning of Blåvatnet Lake trail in the Lyngen Alps</i></p>

<p>41. For the second day at Lyngen we chose an even easier trail, pretty much just an extremely gently-sloping
    climb across tundra and a scree field to <b>Blåvatnet Lake</b> <i>(Norw. Blue Lake)</i>, a glacial lake at the foot of several mountains,
    known for its brilliant blue color.  Unlike Lyngseidet and Steindalen, Blåvatnet is located at the western side 
    of the mountain chain, which looks significantly more harsh and Arctic (eastern side on the other hand is pretty lush).
</p>

<p><a id="42" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8410/28103052814_65ed0a7e71_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8410/28103052814_57ddc50c34_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8410/28103052814_c203e6b7d4_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="42" title="Blåvatnet Lake" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>
<i>Blåvatnet Lake in the Lyngen Alps</i></p>

<p>42. The lake as it turns out is indeed very blue.</p>

<p>After this hike, we drove towards Tromsø.  This time the distance was not very great, and moreover we managed 
    to catch the ferry across the next fjord (Ullsfjorden).  So we were at our AirBnB apartment in Tromsø
    (booked for three nights) by 4 PM already.

<p><a id="43" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8753/28436167540_93b994f702_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8753/28436167540_8527bbebd4_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8753/28436167540_d1dcffd557_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="43" title="Tromsø" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>
<i>Tromsø downtown</i></p>

<p>43. We took a walk around Tromsø in the evening.  <b>Tromsø</b> (population 60,000) is the capital and the biggest city
of Troms County, and in effect the center of the entire Northern Norway.  It is an old and quite interesting town, 
located on an island in a maze of fjords and straits, with a cozy-looking wooden downtown.</p>

<h4>Day 12: Senja Island</h4>

<p><a id="44" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8883/28642807741_32fa964170_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8883/28642807741_9c27cf3566_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8883/28642807741_1b7f21951f_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="44" title="Senjatrollet" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>
<i>Senjatrollet Park on Senja Island</i></p>

<p>44. Since the weather on that day got great again, we decided to spend it by driving to <b>Senja Island</b>, said to be one of 
    the prettiest places in Northern Norway, somewhat resembling the famous Lofoten Islands.  Our first mistake was
    trying to drive there through backcountry roads, west from Tromsø (through Kvaløya Island and Malangen).  That
    turned out to be a long and exhausting drive, with pretty much nothing to see along the way.  The hour was pretty late
    when we finally reached Senja; the first thing we saw there was Senjatrollet Park, with supposedly the biggest
    troll sculpture in the world.
</p>

<p><a id="45" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8249/28104870733_c3b57312f6_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8249/28104870733_10050d50a8_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8249/28104870733_c3ccb0da35_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="45" title="Bergsbotn at Senja" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>
<i>View from Bergsbotn rest area on Senja Island</i></p>

<p>45. We didn't make many plans about what to do on Senja, and ended up just driving around its coast, stopping here and there
    to take some pictures.  So I've got some nice Senja pictures, but our actual time there wasn't all that 
    exciting.  I wanted to hike up some small mountain, but we didn't really have the time for that either.</p>

<p><a id="46" href="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7474/28642794351_075e479b93_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7474/28642794351_0095013908_c.jpg 1x, https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7474/28642794351_156fac9501_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="46" title="Tungeneset at Senja" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>
<i>Tungeneset rest area on Senja Island</i></p>

<p>46. Senja is actually a very big island (second largest in Norway, and three times larger than Magerøya), and 
    most of it is also not especially notable.  There's a small national park in the southwest of the island, but the best
    known and the most accessible part is its small fjords on the western and northwestern coast.  The road along this coast
    which we drove on is also classifed as a National Tourist Route.  
</p>

<p>Our overall impression of Senja was that it is certainly very nice and beautiful, but deserves a more in-depth look.
    Senja was the only part of our overall trip that felt too rushed.  Anyway, after driving around Senja we returned back
    to Tromsø on the main E6 and E8 routes, and found this road to be not only shorter and easier to drive, but more scenic
    as well.  So not every alternate backcountry road in Norway is actually worth driving.</p>

<h4>Day 13: Tromsø.  Arctic Museum.  Storsteinen</h4>

<p><a id="47" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8575/28104863833_1a8caf5c42_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8575/28104863833_852f5d9553_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8575/28104863833_8838aee978_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="47" title="Tromsø harbor" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>
<i>Tromsø harbor</i></p>

<p>47. The next day we explored Tromsø itself, and liked it a lot (the good weather persisted throughout the
remaining days).  After a walk at the waterfront and buying some postcards, we decided to go to the three
main museums of Tromsø, which share an entry ticket: Arctic Museum, Tromsø University Museum, and Polstjerna museum boat.</p>

<p><a id="48" href="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7578/28687790476_05ab314125_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7578/28687790476_a386aeacd2_c.jpg 1x, https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7578/28687790476_f1753abc87_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="48" title="Arctic Museum" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>
<i>Tromsø Arctic Museum</i></p>

<p>48. We only could visit the Arctic Museum on that day (they close fairly early), but that was the best one of the three.
It has a very comprehensive exhibition mostly about the exploration of the Arctic (particularly focusing on Norwegian efforts,
by Amundsen and Nansen), and also whaling, seal trapping, and similar subjects.  I ended up buying a thick book in the 
museum shop, a copy of the old English translation of Amundsen's own account of his journey to the South Pole.
</p>

<p><a id="49" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8656/28102889464_a131a459ec_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8656/28102889464_8c3b35a586_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8656/28102889464_709e3783ee_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="49" title="Arctic Cathedral" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>
<i>Arctic Cathedral and Tromsdalen Valley</i></p>

<p>49. After the museum, we crossed Tromsø Bridge on foot -- a long, narrow and tall bridge, one of the three 
    ways to get to Tromsø from the mainland.  At the end of the bridge on the mainland side is the Arctic Cathedral,
    a big Arctic-themed church.  It's not really very interesting on the inside, hardly worth the entry price of 40 krones,
    but hey, at least it had free Wi-Fi.
</p>

<p>Behind the cathedral is Tromsdalen Valley, home to an eponymous suburb of Tromsø.  It ends with a 1200 m tall mountain
    with visible snow patches, the Tromsdalstinden.  Sadly we didn't go to Tromsdalstinden, but at least we climbed the <b>Storsteinen</b>,
    a much smaller mountain, its slope visible in the right side of the picture.</p>

<p><a id="50" href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8672/28436124490_663f261932_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8672/28436124490_26d4c748d4_c.jpg 1x, https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8672/28436124490_ddbdeee2dd_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="50" title="Tromsø bridge and Hurtigruten" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>
<i>View of Tromsø, Tromsø Bridge, and Hurtigruten ferry from the Storsteinen slope</i></p>

<p>50. Climbing Storsteinen is relatively easy in itself, although the forest on its side has lots of mosquitoes (the first 
time we met them since Pasvikdalen), and we were dressed for walking around the city rather than for hiking (hiking boots make 
most of the difference).  There's actually a cable car going to the top of this mountain, but we didn't want to pay for it,
and anyway conquring a mountain (if a small one) by yourself is more fun. </p>

<p><a id="51" href="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8011/28614646742_96704a5102_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8011/28614646742_ff6b60230c_c.jpg 1x, https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8011/28614646742_0d16559a35_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="51" title="Storsteinen viewpoint" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>
<i>Storsteinen viewpoint above Tromsø</i></p>

<p>51. The views from Storsteinen viewpoint are great, and it's easy to see why they built a cable car and
    a restaurant at the top here.  We didn't use the cable car to get down again either, instead 
    picking a very steep trail which goes right under the cable car -- it was particularly easy to slip 
    there without hiking boots.  After a sigh of relief when we reached Tromsdalen again, we walked 
    back to Tromsø, and enjoyed a burger and the beer at some bar.  That was the only time throughout our 
    entire trip we ate out in Norway (excluding gas station food twice or so). </p>

<h4>Day 14: Tromsø University Museum and Polstjerna.  Treriksröset hike</h4>

<p><a id="52" href="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8685/28720570535_b6bc62b59f_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8685/28720570535_bf6644b804_c.jpg 1x, https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8685/28720570535_186ed60f2c_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="52" title="Tromsø University Museum" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>
<i>Tromsø University Museum exposition</i></p>

<p>52. On the day we had to leave Tromsø -- and the entire Norway, actually -- we started by visiting 
    the remaining two museums.  For some reason I thought Tromsø University Museum was about Tromsø itself;
    it's actually more about Arctic nature and the Sami people.  Of course I love the Sami people, so that's 
    awesome too!</p>

<p>The last museum, Polstjerna Boat, is literally just a preserved seal hunting boat, kept in a drydock under a glass roof.
    You can explore most of its interior and see how the seal hunters lived on duty, and where they kept all those 
    seal carcasses.</p>

<p><a id="53" href="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8637/28687769076_062238eb05_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8637/28687769076_4b6c7c00bf_c.jpg 1x, https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8637/28687769076_785abf7f6d_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="53" title="Norwegian-Finnish border" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>
<i>Norwegian-Finnish border crossing at Kilpisjärvi</i></p>

<p>53. Our final stop in Norway was a Burger King next to Tromsø airport, where we got some double
    cheeseburgers.  If Murmansk McDonald's is the northernmost McDonald's in the world, this Burger King
    is the northernmost Burger King in the world, or so we understood; unlike that McDonald's, there's 
    no plaque.  (Tromsø is located a bit farther north than Murmansk, but there are no McDonald's restaurants
    in the entire northern half of Norway.)
</p>

<p>After that we drove on to the south, to Finland, on Route E8, also known as Northern Lights Road.  
    The border is not that far from Tromsø, 160 km away.</p>

<p><a id="54" href="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8565/28642727981_3ef978195d_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8565/28642727981_48587d83ae_c.jpg 1x, https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8565/28642727981_a5cfc71825_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="54" title="Treriksröset trail" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>
<i>View of the Kilpisjärvi Lake from Treriksröset trail</i></p>

<p>54. Our final destination in the entire trip was <b>Treriksröset border stone</b>, at the place where
    Finland, Sweden and Norway borders meet.  I've already been
    there <a target="_blank" href="/en/2016/02/13/lappi7/">last autumn</a>, of course.  This time I wanted 
    to see what it's like in summer, and additionally, we had booked a <i>varaustupa</i> reservable wilderness hut 
    near Treriksröset, and intended to stay the night there.  That would be our first experience with
    wilderness huts.  
</p>

<p>We picked up a hut key from the border station at Kilpisjärvi village, and set off towards Treriksröset.
    The trail is 11-12 km long, going through Malla Strict Nature Reserve.  It first climbs the side of the Malla Mountain,
    goes along it for some time, then descends again towards Kuohkimajärvi and Golddajávri lakes.
    I was carrying most of our bedsheets and food it my backpack, and the initial ascent hit me hard,
    to the degree I considered giving up, going back, and just finding any random hotel to sleep in.
    Still, I went on, and felt somewhat better afterwards.</p>

<p><a id="55" href="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8839/28642723651_6977ebe0fc_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8839/28642723651_ee972fb1d1_c.jpg 1x, https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8839/28642723651_9b0ba93b15_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="55" title="Treriksröset trail" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>
<i>Treriksröset trail</i></p>

<p>55. In this region, pretty far from the sea, mosquitoes were really the worst.  Without a repellent
    it's tolerable while you walk, but as soon as you stop for a second they just cover you.
    The repellent (provided you re-apply it regularly) provides something like a 90% resistance;
    there are just enough persistent mosquitoes remaining to be hugely annoying.  
</p>

<p><a id="56" href="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8078/28642680541_b3fded19ef_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8078/28642680541_9be2bcc00f_c.jpg 1x, https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8078/28642680541_2262cefdb8_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="56" title="Kuohkimajärvi Reservable Wilderness Hut" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>
<i>Kuohkimajärvi Reservable Wilderness Hut</i></p>

<p>56. We were tired enough that we didn't bother to look at the border stone itself, just going straight 
    to our hut.  It had beds enough for ten, but no one except us was inside, although we saw some people
    using the nearby free wilderness hut <i>(autiotupa)</i>.  </p>

<p>The hut was furnished well (with more than enough dishes in particular), and had a wood and a gas stove
    (although we failed to get the gas one to work), but otherwise it's pretty basic.  No water, toilet,
    or electricity of course.  The water is available from the nearby stream, there's an outhouse,
    and as for electricity, well, too bad.</p>

<p>Sleeping in the hut turned out to be difficult due again to the mosquitoes.  Of course they were much less
    numerous here than outside, but still numerous enough to make sleeping without covering yourself entirely 
    impossible.</p>

<h4>Days 15 and 16: Return from Treriksröset.  Back to St. Petersburg</h4>

<p><a id="57" href="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8816/28642718471_b6881628fe_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8816/28642718471_fac1ca71d7_c.jpg 1x, https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8816/28642718471_7e1a3ca691_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="57" title="Treriksröset border stone" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>
<i>Treriksröset border stone</i></p>

<p>57. After killing some thirty mosquitoes in the morning, and having a breakfast of sorts, we 
    went to see Treriksröset itself before setting out back.  Here it is, a rock by the coast of 
    Golddajávri Lake.  You can hike onwards to Norway or Sweden from here, if you feel like it. </p>

<p><a id="58" href="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8762/28104814403_6d14a4429f_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8762/28104814403_535c9a3baa_c.jpg 1x, https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8762/28104814403_605253921a_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="58" title="Reindeer on Treriksröset trail" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>
<i>Reindeer encountered on Treriksröset trail</i></p>

<p>58. Hiking back to Kilpisjärvi was slightly easier.  There were fewer mosquitoes, but the weather got 
    extremely hot for what is pretty much the coldest place in Finland.
</p>

<p><a id="59" href="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8701/28642709881_b9c81b7494_o.jpg" target="_blank"><img srcset="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8701/28642709881_de22f22e02_c.jpg 1x, https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8701/28642709881_539886ac47_h.jpg 2x" width="800" height="534" alt="59" title="Northern Lights Road" class="img-thumbnail"></a><br>
<i>Finnish National Road 21 (Northern Lights Road) somewhere between Kilpisjärvi and Palojoensuu</i></p>

<p>59. We ate at a restaurant in Kilpisjärvi (finally a country where we can afford eating in restaurants!),
    and drove south on the Northern Lights Road.  The road seemed very boring in summer, although much easier 
    to drive than Norwegian roads.
</p>

<p>60. We took a few pictures on the Finnish-Swedish border bridge at Karesuando, and at the Arctic Circle crossing
    in Pello Municipality, then drove non-stop to a motel in the town of Keminmaa in Southern Lapland.  It sure was nice
    to sleep in a room without any mosquitoes!

<p>There's not much to tell about the last day.  We just drove through entire Finland back home, on Roads 4,
    22, and 6.  We hit a duck somewhere near Muhos, but it apparently still flew away.  Overall, we drove 470 km
    on Day 15, and about 900 km on Day 16.</p>

<p>And that's all with the brief version of the trip report!  Detailed posts about all these places are to come.</p>
