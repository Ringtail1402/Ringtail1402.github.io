I&rsquo;ve just read a&nbsp;book by&nbsp;some Mrs. Alec Tweedie, an&nbsp;English woman
	who travelled around Finland in&nbsp;1897. She had previously been to&nbsp;Iceland and
	Norway; and all of&nbsp;these three countries were as&nbsp;far from popular tourist
	destinations as&nbsp;possible at&nbsp;the time. Mrs. Tweedie, a&nbsp;woman in&nbsp;her late
	thirties, recently widowed, went to&nbsp;Finland for three months, with her sister
	and a&nbsp;local companion, communicating with the locals mostly in&nbsp;German
	(whenever at&nbsp;all possible; although Finns speaking excellent English were
	occasionally encountered in&nbsp;surprising places). The book, named
	<i>Through Finland in&nbsp;Carts</i>, is&nbsp;available for free now in
	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Through-Finland-Carts-Alec-Mrs-Tweedie-ebook/dp/B0082V2TDU">Kindle Store</a>
	 (in&nbsp;fact&nbsp;I stumbled upon it&nbsp;when&nbsp;I just tried typing &ldquo;finland&rdquo; into Kindle
	 search). It&nbsp;is&nbsp;the 3rd edition, published in&nbsp;1913, and containing many notes
	 on&nbsp;the changes in&nbsp;Finland since the time of&nbsp;the actual travel.</p>
	 
<p>Overall I&nbsp;wasn&rsquo;t a&nbsp;great fan of&nbsp;Mrs. Tweedie&rsquo;s prose. It&nbsp;seems a&nbsp;bit amateurish
	and the author is&nbsp;obviously trying too hard at&nbsp;times (although I&nbsp;do admit it
	strongly reminded me&nbsp;of&nbsp;<i>Three Men in&nbsp;a&nbsp;Boat</i>, sans humor; and <i>Three Men in&nbsp;a&nbsp;Boat</i>
	is&nbsp;a&nbsp;great book). Still, it&nbsp;was an&nbsp;extraordinarily interesting read for&nbsp;me, since
	I&rsquo;m such a&nbsp;big fan on&nbsp;Finland. Mrs. Tweedie she actually paints a&nbsp;very good and
	fairly complete picture of&nbsp;Finland on&nbsp;the eve of&nbsp;the 20th century, even going to
	some lengths to&nbsp;describe not only the sights or&nbsp;the people, but also the industry,
	the agriculture, and in&nbsp;general what the people actually do&nbsp;for their living. So&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll try to&nbsp;summarize some of&nbsp;the most interesting details mentioned in&nbsp;the book.</p>
	
<ul class="spaced">
	<li>The actual route was: Helsinki&nbsp;&mdash; Vyborg&nbsp;&mdash; Valaam&nbsp;&mdash; Sortavala&nbsp;&mdash; Imatra &mdash;
		Savonlinna&nbsp;&mdash; Kuopio&nbsp;&mdash; Iisalmi&nbsp;&mdash; Kajaani&nbsp;&mdash; Oulu&nbsp;&mdash; Hanko. Despite the name, the ladies
		actually enjoyed multiple modes of&nbsp;travel, including also railroads, steamships
		(including the entire Oulu&nbsp;&mdash; Hanko leg), and boats used for trasporting tar. 
		They also changed several other companions over the course of&nbsp;their trip.
		The one who accompanied them most was &ldquo;Grandpapa&rdquo;, a&nbsp;young Finnish man
		from a&nbsp;wealthy family, who got this nickname from them for his solemn demeanor.</li>
		 
	<li>The author entered Finland by&nbsp;a&nbsp;steamship, of&nbsp;course, taking 4.5 days to&nbsp;sail
		from Hull, England. Finland was very little known at&nbsp;the time, and she hadn&rsquo;t 
		even been able to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;decent guidebook or&nbsp;a&nbsp;map of&nbsp;the country before setting off.</li>
		
	<li>At&nbsp;the time Hanko was the only usable Finnish port in&nbsp;winter (due to&nbsp;its relatively
		outlying location), and even it&nbsp;sometimes had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;closed for weeks. Icebreakers
		already existed but were not powerful enough to&nbsp;clear waterways for any other seaport.
		Hanko thus was much more important in&nbsp;those times than now. The author went in
		summer, of&nbsp;course. In&nbsp;fact she was surprised by&nbsp;how outright hot the Finnish summer was.</li>
		 
	<li>Helsinki was the only half-decent city they saw. Every other Finnish city is
		described as&nbsp;a&nbsp;small, ugly and absolutely uninspiring mess of&nbsp;wooden shacks
		(including Vyborg which had been the second largest city of&nbsp;Finland). 
		I&nbsp;suppose there must have been some exagerration to&nbsp;this, though. 
		Although Finnish cities still are often described as&nbsp;boring, there are
		certainly some beautiful landmarks and old neighborhoods predating 1897.</li>
		
	<li>Very surprisingly, the Finns are over and over described as&nbsp;quite slow and
		tardy people! Like for example, if&nbsp;a&nbsp;Finn says he&nbsp;will do&nbsp;something &ldquo;right away&rdquo;,
		that means &ldquo;in&nbsp;20&nbsp;minutes&rdquo; in&nbsp;best case. This is&nbsp;particularly interesting
		as&nbsp;there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;strong stereotype of&nbsp;Finns being slow (though not as&nbsp;slow as
		Estonians) in&nbsp;Russia. Which these times does not seem to&nbsp;be&nbsp;true at&nbsp;all.</li>
		
	<li>The Finns are also repeatedly described as&nbsp;homely and even ugly people, 
		usually thickset if&nbsp;not outright fat, and with quite rough features. Even
		women, and especially women. This is&nbsp;of&nbsp;course a&nbsp;subjective matter but
		I&nbsp;absolutely wouldn&rsquo;t call a&nbsp;typical modern Finn homely.</li>
		
	<li>Nonetheless, the Finns are said to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;general a&nbsp;very friendly, reliable, 
		and welcoming (if&nbsp;introverted and very stoic) people. Many Finns, especially 
		from the rural areas, displayed childlike amazement at&nbsp;meeting actual living
		&ldquo;English ladies&rdquo; (they even were written about in&nbsp;local papers throughout their journey).
		The author notes that Northern people in&nbsp;general have a&nbsp;sort of&nbsp;moral
		integrity that is&nbsp;sadly lacking in&nbsp;people from the more southern countries.</li>
		
	<li>The Finns are in&nbsp;particular often compared to&nbsp;the Scots, and their
		cultures are said to&nbsp;resemble a&nbsp;good deal.</li>
		 
	<li>Bikes were already very popular at&nbsp;least in&nbsp;Helsinki (which had
		a&nbsp;population of&nbsp;150,000) back then. The roads however were very rough, both in&nbsp;cities
		and in&nbsp;the country. 
		The Finns allegedly weren&rsquo;t much bothered by&nbsp;that, saying &ldquo;well they&rsquo;re
		covered with snow for like half an&nbsp;year anyway&rdquo;.</li>
		
	<li>Women already enjoyed a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;rights in&nbsp;1897 (although they were 
		allowed to&nbsp;vote and to&nbsp;be&nbsp;elected into Parliament only in&nbsp;1906, but Finland
		 still was the first country in&nbsp;Europe to&nbsp;allow that), which was a&nbsp;continuous 
		 source of&nbsp;wonder for the author, who was quite feminist-minded. In&nbsp;particular 
		 lots of&nbsp;students of&nbsp;University of&nbsp;Helsinki were women. Women however also
		 performed a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;physically demanding jobs usually performed by&nbsp;men, such 
		 as&nbsp;cleaning streets, or&nbsp;building houses. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;also mentioned that Finnish women 
		 gained the right to&nbsp;marry freely (without permission of&nbsp;their father, mother, or 
		 any surviving eldest relative) in&nbsp;1864. Divorces, at&nbsp;the moment of&nbsp;the writing, 
		 still were not granted freely (adultery and prolonged (one year) absence of&nbsp;one 
		 party were valid grounds), which is&nbsp;still claimed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;much more free state 
		 of&nbsp;affairs than was usual in&nbsp;England at&nbsp;the time. Inheritance laws are also 
		 described at&nbsp;some length, and were also quite fair to&nbsp;female children.</li>
		 
	<li>Drinking coffee was already a&nbsp;pretty universal custom (and still&nbsp;is).</li>
	
	<li>Finland was a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;Russia in&nbsp;that era, but there still were border
		controls between Finland and Russia, and obtaining a&nbsp;passport was required to&nbsp;cross
		the border (although that wasn&rsquo;t difficult). The author obliviously claims this
		helps to&nbsp;keep out anarchists, socialists, Jews, and beggars. Yeah, one of&nbsp;these
		things is&nbsp;not like the others.</li>
		
	<li>The censure was active in&nbsp;Finland, just like it&nbsp;was in&nbsp;Russia. Foreign 
		newspapers from Britain, Germany, etc., were available, but entire paragraphs 
		were blacked out from them by&nbsp;hand. This probably worked the same as&nbsp;in&nbsp;Russia, 
		I&nbsp;just had no&nbsp;idea that they actually went to&nbsp;these lenghts. I&nbsp;mean you could 
		just forbid selling any foreign newspapers at&nbsp;all, right?</li>
		
	<li>Russian soldiers were occasionally seen at&nbsp;least in&nbsp;Helsinki (looking very shabby). 
		There were very few Russians in&nbsp;Finland otherwise. The Finns were somewhat 
		resentful towards them for being arrogant towards Finland, and not 
		really making an&nbsp;effort to&nbsp;understand&nbsp;it. (Note that this had been just 
		before the Russification policy started in&nbsp;Finland, and practically speaking
		 the Finns had little reason to&nbsp;complain at&nbsp;the time.)</li>
		 
	<li>The Finns already routinely built summer cottages on&nbsp;various islands and 
		in&nbsp;other remote corners of&nbsp;the country. The author claims that families 
		retreated to&nbsp;these cottages for entire summer. This couldn&rsquo;t include the 
		breadwinner of&nbsp;the family, I&nbsp;assume?</li>
		
	<li>I&nbsp;won&rsquo;t describe the gastronomical part of&nbsp;the journey as&nbsp;this is&nbsp;honestly 
		the most boring part for&nbsp;me. The peasants brewed and drank a&nbsp;small beer named 
		kalja, for what it&rsquo;s worth.</li>
		
	<li>Despite having a&nbsp;small and poor population, Finland already enjoyed some 
		inventions which were uncommon elsewhere at&nbsp;the time, such as&nbsp;telephone. 
		The author even retells an&nbsp;anecdote where a&nbsp;young man, named Pekka of&nbsp;course, 
		asks a&nbsp;beautiful girl Ilma to&nbsp;marry him over the phone, and she is&nbsp;overjoyed 
		to&nbsp;accept; but when he&nbsp;actually goes to&nbsp;her house, he&nbsp;discovered that it 
		actually was Ilma&rsquo;s mother who he&nbsp;talked&nbsp;to; she just happened to&nbsp;had been 
		secretly in&nbsp;love with him.</li>
		
	<li>Mosquitos and deer flies were extremely, absolutely horrible. In&nbsp;fact it 
		was because of&nbsp;mosquitoes that the author in&nbsp;the end decided against going 
		to&nbsp;the north of&nbsp;Oulu, to&nbsp;Lapland (the original plan was to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;steamer 
		from Oulu to&nbsp;Tornio and continue northwards, presumably along what was to 
		become the Northern Lights Road later). Bed bugs were also a&nbsp;huge bane 
		of&nbsp;peasant dwellings, and a&nbsp;few times prevented the ladies from sleeping at 
		all; another nuisance was a&nbsp;nasty smell from whatever weed the peasants 
		routinely used to&nbsp;stuff the mattresses.</li>
		
	<li>Of&nbsp;course saunas are a&nbsp;big subject and have their own chapter devoted to&nbsp;them, 
		but there wasn&rsquo;t anything particularly surprising&nbsp;&mdash; way too hot, awkward that 
		you&rsquo;re expected to&nbsp;bathe naked, etc. Well there also was the fact that 
		saunas were more often called bastu in&nbsp;the educated circles, which simply 
		means sauna in&nbsp;Swedish. Washing in&nbsp;hot tubs meanwhile was an&nbsp;utterly 
		alien concept for the Finns.</li>
		
	<li>Apart from the saunas though there were also anthill baths. Basically 
		an&nbsp;anthill was just plunged into hot water, and then you bathed among 
		corpses of&nbsp;dead boiled ants. That was&nbsp;a, how do&nbsp;you say&nbsp;it, popular 
		cosmetological procedure at&nbsp;the time.</li>
		
	<li>Valaam Monastery was pretty much the same as&nbsp;any Orthodox monastery 
		still is&nbsp;to&nbsp;this day. By&nbsp;far the most striking impression of&nbsp;the monastery 
		for the author was meeting a&nbsp;young Russian monk (with a&nbsp;German mother so 
		he&nbsp;spoke German), Brother Sebastian, originally from Moscow, who was 
		sent to&nbsp;the monastery by&nbsp;his rich and influential father three years 
		before for some undisclosed offense. He&nbsp;was already free to&nbsp;return 
		back to&nbsp;secular life after three years, but he&nbsp;claimed he&nbsp;didn&rsquo;t want 
		to, having been entirely disconnected from the world for so&nbsp;long, not 
		even knowing for sure who the Tzar was at&nbsp;the time. He&nbsp;appeared deeply unhappy.</li>
		
	<li>In&nbsp;Sortavala, the ladies saw a&nbsp;festival of&nbsp;Runo singers. Runo singing and 
		Kalevala is&nbsp;described at&nbsp;length; a&nbsp;traditional Karelian wedding was 
		also witnessed. There were also some more modern performances, 
		like a&nbsp;peasant drama named Anna Liisa, by&nbsp;Minna Canth. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;retold 
		in&nbsp;great detail, taking up&nbsp;fifteen pages. It&nbsp;does not actually end 
		with everyone dying, but the heroine confesses to&nbsp;having murdered 
		her own baby, and is&nbsp;arrested and presumably executed in&nbsp;the end. 
		This kind of&nbsp;plot is&nbsp;perfectly normal for Finland.</li>
		
	<li>Imatra waterfall is&nbsp;described as&nbsp;if&nbsp;it&nbsp;was the greatest wonder of&nbsp;the world. 
		I&nbsp;wonder if&nbsp;it&nbsp;had been more impressive before the big power station was 
		built. Not that it&nbsp;isn&rsquo;t impressive now, mind you. The author also 
		laments poor accommodation and spoiled nature, both of&nbsp;these factors 
		deterring possible tourists. Of&nbsp;course nowadays Finland has great 
		accommodation options, and unspoiled (or&nbsp;seemingly unspoiled) nature 
		seems to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the whole point of&nbsp;the country.</li>
		
	<li>Juhannus (Midsummer) celebrations with a&nbsp;huge bonfire were seen 
		on&nbsp;Ilke&auml;saari, a&nbsp;minor island near Vyborg where the estate of&nbsp;one 
		of&nbsp;ladies&rsquo; companions was located. I&nbsp;failed to&nbsp;find this island 
		on&nbsp;any old maps, or&nbsp;even any mentions of&nbsp;this island outside this book. 
		Perhaps the name of&nbsp;the island was misspelled although it&nbsp;sounds
		valid (and translates as&nbsp;&ldquo;Bad Island&rdquo;).</li>
		
	<li>Education was very good and accessible, by&nbsp;the standards of&nbsp;the era. 
		Children attended primary school unversally, and pretty much everyone
		was literate, in&nbsp;stark contrast with Russian peasantry. Each 
		municipality had at&nbsp;least one school. Over a&nbsp;hundred secondary 
		schools also existed throughout the country. Primary schools were 
		free and secondary schools were very cheap. Teachers enjoyed a&nbsp;good 
		salary and were a&nbsp;very respected class. Even the University only 
		demanded a&nbsp;reasonable one-time entry fee (and small fees for 
		examinations and use of&nbsp;laboratories).</li>
		 
	<li>In&nbsp;Savonlinna, the ladies actually stayed in&nbsp;Olavinlinna castle, which 
		remains the greatest attraction of&nbsp;the city to&nbsp;this day. At&nbsp;the time 
		Olavinlinna was mostly deserted. The ladies were lodged not literally 
		in&nbsp;the medieval halls, but rather in&nbsp;the more modern guardhouse, apparently 
		the same one where entry tickets are sold now. Even that was unversally 
		considered absolutely unsuitable for English ladies, and everyone tried 
		to&nbsp;talk them out of&nbsp;it. The stay was indeed not particularly comfortable 
		(and the castle was quite creepy) but not much worse than some of&nbsp;their 
		other experiences. Punkaharju, a&nbsp;town near Savonlinna the location of&nbsp;which
		is&nbsp;even more picturesque, was also advised to&nbsp;them by&nbsp;pretty much
		everyone as&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the great attractions of&nbsp;Finland.</li>
		
	<li>Wood, the &ldquo;green gold&rdquo; of&nbsp;Finland, was obviously the principal export
		of&nbsp;the country, and that could be&nbsp;easily seen, with logs transported
		in&nbsp;sleds in&nbsp;winter, then floated in&nbsp;huge log rafts over all inland 
		waterways in&nbsp;summer, to&nbsp;be&nbsp;collected in&nbsp;great stacks in&nbsp;the port cities
		like Kotka, where they were sawn on&nbsp;steam sawmills and loaded on&nbsp;ships. 
		In&nbsp;off-season, a&nbsp;million logs could be&nbsp;stacked in&nbsp;Kotka at&nbsp;any single 
		moment; remember that all ports but Hanko were frozen in&nbsp;winter at&nbsp;the time.</li>
		
	<li>As&nbsp;far as&nbsp;other exports&nbsp;go, butter and cheese were, perhaps 
		surprisingly, a&nbsp;pretty important one. Much of&nbsp;these were exported to 
		Britain, and the author laments the allegedly sad state of&nbsp;cheesemaking in 
		England itself. Meanwhile the majority of&nbsp;consumer goods and machinery 
		were imported from Germany.</li>
		
	<li>Travelling in&nbsp;carts sometimes required the use of&nbsp;cable ferries <i>(lossi)</i>,
		much more common at&nbsp;the time in&nbsp;fact, as&nbsp;lots of&nbsp;bridges didn&rsquo;t exist yet. 
		The ferries, which were little more than small rafts, were awkward and 
		scary to&nbsp;use. They likely were already free to&nbsp;use just as&nbsp;they are now 
		(or&nbsp;at&nbsp;least no&nbsp;payment is&nbsp;mentioned). Another feature of&nbsp;cart roads 
		were common <i>majatalo</i> houses, basically inns/postal stations, which
		could differ a&nbsp;lot in&nbsp;the conditions they offfered. They were spaced 8-12 miles 
		apart and operated by&nbsp;well-off local farmers, subsidized by&nbsp;the government. 
		The usual and fairly affordable mode of&nbsp;land travel was with postal carriages.</li>
		
	<li>A&nbsp;rural church near Iisalmi was visited and a&nbsp;service there was witnessed 
		but there doesn&rsquo;t seem to&nbsp;be&nbsp;anything unusual to&nbsp;tell about, apart from the 
		fact that the service reminded the author very strongly of&nbsp;Scotland churches. 
		Peasants were regularly examined by&nbsp;the pastor on&nbsp;their basic knowledge of 
		the Bible. I&nbsp;remember the scene of&nbsp;such an&nbsp;examination from <i>Emil of&nbsp;L&ouml;nneberga</i> 
		book by&nbsp;Astrid Lindgren; that was in&nbsp;Sweden of&nbsp;course but it&nbsp;seems that 
		particular custom didn&rsquo;t differ here. Passing the examination was in 
		particular a&nbsp;prerequisite for marriage. This probably was one of&nbsp;the 
		reasons literacy was so&nbsp;high even among peasants.</li>
		
	<li>Author&rsquo;s sister actually lugged around a&nbsp;bulky photo camera (a&nbsp;kodak; 
		this word for photo camera was pretty much a&nbsp;generic trademark at&nbsp;the time) 
		and took a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;pictures but consistently failed to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;dark room to 
		develop them. At&nbsp;the end she had to&nbsp;plug all windows and the like, 
		and yet the film still ended up&nbsp;spoiled and thus, no&nbsp;pictures in&nbsp;this book.</li>
		
	<li>At&nbsp;Iisalmi, the author witnessed a&nbsp;wedding among the poorest peasants, 
		those who lived in&nbsp;<i>savupirtti</i> houses, which lacked a&nbsp;chimney and were
		black with smoke from the inside. They were <i>torppari</i>&nbsp;&mdash; those who
		didn&rsquo;t own land but rather rented it&nbsp;from a&nbsp;more wealthy owner. A&nbsp;funny 
		custom was that the groom wasn&rsquo;t to&nbsp;(formally) ask for the hand of&nbsp;his bride 
		himself; rather a&nbsp;friend of&nbsp;his accompanied him and spoke for him, while the 
		groom remained silent. Overall despite the poverty these people seemed 
		to&nbsp;be&nbsp;quite optimistic and fairly happy with their lives.</li>
		
	<li>The Kajaani&nbsp;&mdash; Oulu journey was in&nbsp;a&nbsp;tar boat. The importance of&nbsp;tar 
		as&nbsp;Finland&rsquo;s major export was falling fast at&nbsp;the time (as&nbsp;its major use is 
		for construction of&nbsp;wooden ship hulls, and wooden ships were already rare), 
		but it&nbsp;still was the traidional industry of&nbsp;Kajaani region (Kainuu). 
		Tar was extracted from trees in&nbsp;tar-pits <i>(tervahauta)</i>, large outdoor
		ovens where wood was left to&nbsp;smoulder, covered over to&nbsp;ensure the 
		absence of&nbsp;air, for days. Tar barrels were then loaded on&nbsp;long narrow 
		dangerous-looking boats, and floated through Ouluj&auml;rvi lake and Oulujoki river,
		past Vaala and Muhos towns, to&nbsp;the port of&nbsp;Oulu. Indeed,
		the modern Oulu-Kajaani highway (National Road&nbsp;22) along Oulujoki and Ouluj&auml;rvi 
		is&nbsp;also designated as&nbsp;<i>Tervan tie</i>, &ldquo;tar road&rdquo;; I&nbsp;happened to&nbsp;drive on&nbsp;it 
		on&nbsp;my&nbsp;own return trip from Lapland. Tar boats had to&nbsp;pass some narrow locks, 
		avoid storms common on&nbsp;Ouluj&auml;rvi, and navigate some dangerous rapids on&nbsp;Oulujoki, 
		with help from local pilots. The boat on&nbsp;which the ladies sailed happened 
		to&nbsp;encounter unusual thick fog near the rapids, and had to&nbsp;stop for a&nbsp;while; 
		the ladies slept in&nbsp;a&nbsp;house of&nbsp;a&nbsp;local peasant, who again was very welcoming 
		and glad to&nbsp;help, although the beds and conditions in&nbsp;his house were quite deplorable.</li>
		
	<li>In&nbsp;Oulu they witnessed salmon fishing with great nets on&nbsp;Oulujoki river. 
		Nothing much to&nbsp;tell about&nbsp;it. And then they boarded a&nbsp;steamer for Hanko. 
		The steamer was virtually the only ship or&nbsp;machine burning coal, rather than wood, 
		that they saw in&nbsp;Finland. Finland never had its own coal, and why bother with 
		coal anyway if&nbsp;you have so&nbsp;much cheep wood. Oulu-Hanko steamer (actually to&nbsp;continue
		on&nbsp;to&nbsp;St. Petersburg after Hanko) was moored very close to&nbsp;huge tar warehouses 
		in&nbsp;Oulu, and thus it&nbsp;was imperative for it&nbsp;to&nbsp;avoid sparks flying out of 
		smoke stacks, which was common with wood-burning steamships.</li>
		
	<li>Some of&nbsp;the passengers on&nbsp;this steamer were emigrants, which were
		to&nbsp;depart Hanko for the United States then. I&nbsp;remember seeing a&nbsp;small 
		monument to&nbsp;all the Finnish emigrants in&nbsp;Hanko, depicting birds flying away; 
		it&nbsp;is&nbsp;very poignant. Finnish emigrants generally did well in&nbsp;the United States, 
		and many of&nbsp;them actually returned back to&nbsp;their beloved homeland after 
		getting more or&nbsp;less rich. The steamer meanwhile stopped in&nbsp;Jakobstad, Vaasa 
		(which was noted by&nbsp;the author for having girls and women unusually beautiful 
		for Finland), and Turku (where they were shown some mummies in&nbsp;the crypts 
		of&nbsp;Turku cathedral, whatever these were).</li>
		 
	<li>Apart from being a&nbsp;winter port, Hanko was (and still&nbsp;is) also a&nbsp;resort town, 
		also particularly favored by&nbsp;Russian nobles and officers. The ladies met 
		a&nbsp;Russian Admiral there, and witnessed Orthodox christening in&nbsp;the local 
		church. And, well, this is&nbsp;where it&nbsp;ended. They departed Finland, noting in&nbsp;the end:
		
		<blockquote>Our eyes were tired with sights, our minds were chaotic
			with strange ideas and tongues, but yet we&nbsp;felt how misunderstood that
			beautiful country&nbsp;is, how well worthy of&nbsp;careful study, 
			and what a&nbsp;delightful new field it&nbsp;opens up&nbsp;to&nbsp;the traveller who, 
			though he&nbsp;believes he&nbsp;&ldquo;knows all Europe,&rdquo;
			yet has omitted Suomi, one of&nbsp;her quaintest gems.</blockquote>

		Which is&nbsp;pretty much how&nbsp;I feel about Finland myself, anyway.</li>
