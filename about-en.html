<p>My name is <b>Alexander Ulyanov</b>, and this humble website is where I publish
    a few notes, both in Russian and in English.</p>

<p>I am 26; I was born in Yekaterinburg (about the middle of Russia), studied
    English and Linguistics in college (not for long), and moved into <b>St.&nbsp;Petersburg</b>
    in 2011.  St.&nbsp;Petersburg, Leninski Avenue is where I happen to live at the moment
    with my significant other.  I love St.&nbsp;Petersburg.  It is large, and it has sea,
    and it is the only Russian city (apart from Moscow maybe) which does not insult
    my aesthetic sense.</p>

<p><b>I love</b> local history, and, to the point of geekdom, topography, toponymy, and
    public transit.  I know entire St.&nbsp;Petersburg by heart, and this is almost not an
    exagerration.  I love travel, especially by car, and Northern Europe, although
    I can enjoy Russian backwater as well.  I like stories and movies where evil prevails,
    or at least some really dark and/or antisocial good.  I like unhealthy food,
    raccoons and rabbits, being a smartass, taking photos of places of interest,
    driving my old Daewoo Matiz or walking around the city, procrastinating with my laptop
    and drinking beer, pretty much whatever everyone does.  I have very liberal views,
    and as Dostoyevsky said, that always makes one somewhat of a Russophobe.  Nonetheless
    I'm of fairly high opinion about the humanity in general, and I believe there are
    nowhere as many assholes in the world as it is commonly believed.  This still
    doesn't prevent me from being as asocial as befits a neckbeard geek.  Although I
    have no beard.</p>

<p>I work as a <b>Lead Developer in <a target="_blank" href="http://vps2fast.com/">FastVPS</a>
    web hosting company</b> <span class="text-muted">(and sorry about the broken English,
    we'll get around to it, I swear)</span>.  Hosting Your Success, as our slogan goes.
    Seriously, we're really an awesome VPS hosting shop, the very best there is, everyone
    else just plain sucks.  I develop and maintain our billing system, which surprisingly is
    a lot more fun than it sounds.</p>

<p>More precisely (not looking for a job at the moment, but still) I'm a <b>full stack
    web developer</b>, specializing on the backend, with modern PHP and Symfony&nbsp;2
    web framework.  I have loads of expertise with Symfony, particularly in the area
    of legacy code integration, which is what I'm mostly writing about here.
    I like Java a lot, but I only have small real-world experience with it.
    I really dislike frontend and Javascript, but modest-sized single page apps in
    AngularJS are a bit of a guilty pleasure.  Some of my code is available at
    <a href="https://github.com/Ringtail1402">GitHub</a>, but most of what I develop
    is not publicly available.</p>

<p>I have always had difficulties with publishing anything and especially keeping it
    up-to-date on the web, but this website (on GitHub pages) is really small and simple,
    so I hope it won't be quite as bad.</p>
